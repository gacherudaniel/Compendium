# Cross-Cutting Statistics

## Sustainable Development

Sustainable development is development that is able to meet the needs of the current generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It assumes the conservation of natural assets for future growth and development.

### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Also known as the Global Goals, they are an intergovernmental set of development goals which were adopted by the United Nations member states in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity.

### Sustainable Development Goals, Targets and Indicators

The SDG includes 17 goals, 169 targets and 248 indicators. The goals set the aspiration of what the SDGs are trying to achieve. The 169 targets are the areas of change that need to be reached in order to achieve the 17 goals. Indicators are used to measure the progress on the target and goal.

### Global SDG Indicator Framework

A standardized set of 231 indicators adopted by the UN to monitor SDGs progress.      

### Voluntary National Review (VNR)

Country-led assessments presented at the UN to report on SDGs implementation.

### Data Revolution for Sustainable Development

A global movement to improve data quality, timeliness, and inclusivity for better decisions.

### SDG Dashboard

A visual, interactive tool for tracking progress across the SDGs and indicators.      

## Human Rights

The inalienable rights to which a person is entitled merely for being human. Human rights are built on underlying principles of universality, indivisibility, equality, participation, accountability and [non-discrimination](https://www.unhcr.org/glossary#non-discrimination), and are enshrined in international human rights law, rules of customary international law, national laws and other standards that define them and help to guarantee their full enjoyment.

Inherent claims to social arrangements that protect each and every person from abuses and deprivation that would prevent them from attaining their full potential.

### Human Rights Mechanisms

The various human rights monitoring mechanisms of the United Nations system. These include UN Charter-based bodies (including the Human Rights Council, Universal Periodic Review and special procedures) and treaty-based bodies created under the international human rights treaties (known as treaty bodies).

### Human Rights-Based Approach

A conceptual framework underpinning human development and humanitarian action that is normatively based on international [human rights](https://www.unhcr.org/glossary#human-rights) standards and operationally directed to promoting and protecting human rights. A human rights-based approach identifies rights-holders and their entitlements and corresponding duty-bearers and their obligations, and works towards strengthening the capacities of rights-holders to make their claims and of duty-bearers to meet their obligations. It is not only about achieving human rights goals and outcomes, but also about achieving them through a participatory, inclusive, nondiscriminatory, transparent and responsive process.

### International Bill of Human Rights

Documents that form the primary legal basis of United Nations activities to promote, protect and monitor [human rights](https://www.unhcr.org/glossary#human-rights) and fundamental freedoms. These include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR).

### Limitations on Human Rights

Limitations placed by States on the exercise of certain [human rights](https://www.unhcr.org/glossary#human-rights) where they have valid reasons to do so, such as to protect the rights and freedoms of others, for national security, or to protect public health or morals. The burden falls upon States to prove that a limitation imposed upon the enjoyment of the right is legitimate.

### Non-Derogable Rights

Those human rights which cannot be subjected to limitations or suspensions under any conditions, including in times of public emergency. They include the right to life; the right not to be subjected to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; freedom from slavery and servitude; freedom of thought, conscience and religion. These rights are also known as peremptory norms of international law or jus cogens norms.

### Non-Refoulement

A core principle of international human rights and refugee law that prohibits States from returning individuals in any manner whatsoever (whether directly or indirectly) to territories where they may be at risk of persecution, torture, or other forms of serious or irreparable harm.

### National Human Rights Institution (NHRI)

A State institution established by Law or Constitution with a broad mandate to promote and protect human rights. NHRIs are independent institutions that function without interference from the State or any other stakeholders.

### Conflict-Related Deaths

These are deaths for which there are reasonable grounds to believe that they resulted directly from acts of war and that the acts, decisions and/or purposes that caused these deaths were in furtherance of, or under the guise of armed conflict.

### Journalists

These are individuals who observe, document, analyze and document events, statements, policies, and other developments that may impact society. Their primary role is to collect, verify, organize, and report  information in order to inform the public or specific sectors of society. This definition encompasses not only professional full-time reporters and analysts, but also media workers, support staff, community media practitioners, and citizen journalists who temporarily take on journalistic roles. It also includes bloggers and others who engage in self-publication through print, online platforms, or other media channels. Regardless of the medium or employment status, journalists share the common purpose of providing fact-based information and analysis to contribute to an informed society.

### Trade Unionists

Individuals exercising their right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of their interests.

### Trade Union

An association of workers organized to protect and promote their common interests.

### Human Rights Defenders

Individuals who, alone or in association with others, exercise their rights to promote and strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at both national and international levels. This category may include certain journalists and trade unionists. While the term "human rights advocate" is often used synonymously, "human rights defender" is preferred as it aligns more closely with internationally agreed human rights standards and established practice.

### Killing

Any extrajudicial or unlawful execution carried out by State actors or by other actors with the State’s permission, support, or acquiescence, motivated by the victim or someone associated with the victim engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender; or committed while the victim was undertaking such activities. This also includes killings by individuals or groups not supported by the State when the act was motivated by the victim's engagement in such activities and/or was met with a lack of due diligence by the State in responding to the harm, with such inaction motivated by the victim’s or associate’s role. It also includes unlawful attacks and destruction in violation of international humanitarian law that result in or are intended to cause the victim’s death.

### Enforced Disappearance

The arrest, detention, abduction, or any other form of deprivation of liberty of a person by State agents or by persons acting with the authorization, support, or acquiescence of the State, where such acts are motivated by the victim’s or an associate’s engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender. The act is followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the victim’s fate or whereabouts, placing them outside the protection of the law.

### Torture

Any act whereby severe physical or mental pain or suffering is intentionally inflicted on a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender for purposes such as obtaining information or a confession, punishing, intimidating, coercing them, or for reasons based on discrimination of any kind. This applies when the pain or suffering is inflicted by, or with the consent, instigation, or acquiescence of, a public official or someone acting in an official capacity.

### Arbitrary Detention

The arrest or detention of a person that is not in accordance with national laws either because it lacks a legal basis or does not follow established legal procedures and is motivated by the victim’s or an associate’s engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender. It is considered arbitrary when it is inappropriate, unjust, unreasonable, or unnecessary under the circumstances.

### Kidnapping

The unlawful detention, abduction, or confinement of a person without their consent by individuals or groups not acting with the State’s support or acquiescence, where the State fails to exercise due diligence in responding to the incident. Such failure is motivated by the victim’s or an associate’s engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender.

### Other Harmful Acts

Other actions by State actors or by individuals acting with the State’s permission, support, or acquiescence that cause or intend to cause harm, and that are motivated by the victim’s role as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender.

### Verified Cases

Reported cases that include a minimum set of relevant information about the individuals and circumstances involved, and have been reviewed by mandated bodies or mechanisms, which found reasonable grounds to believe that the individuals were victims of human rights violations or abuses.

### Discrimination

Any distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference either direct or indirect based on prohibited grounds, with the intent or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment, or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis in the political, economic, social, cultural, or other public spheres.

### Harassment

A form of discrimination based on prohibited grounds, which may involve words, gestures, or actions that annoy, alarm, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate, or embarrass another person, or create a hostile or offensive environment. While often involving repeated behavior, harassment may also occur as a single incident.

### Agent of Persecution

People or entities responsible for acts or threats of persecution. These may include State Authorities or non-State actors.

### Detention

The deprivation of liberty or confinement in a closed place from which an asylum-seeker cannot leave at will, including prisons or designated detention, reception, or holding centers.

### Alternatives to Detention

Legislation, policies, or practices that allow asylum-seekers to reside in the community under certain conditions or restrictions on movement while their protection claims are processed.

### Asylum Seeker

A general term for a person seeking international protection. In some countries, it has a legal meaning, referring to an individual who has applied for refugee or complementary protection status and is awaiting a final decision. It may also refer to individuals who intend to apply or who may be in need of such protection.

### Displacement

The forced or compelled movement of individuals from their homes or habitual places of residence either within their country or across borders due to armed conflict, generalized violence, human rights violations, or natural or human-made disasters.

### Forced Marriage

A marriage in which one or both parties have not given their full and free consent. Child marriage is considered a form of forced marriage and constitutes a violation of human rights.

### Freedom of Movement

A fundamental human right comprising the freedom to move within a country, the right to leave any country, and the right to return to one's own country.

### Protection

All activities aimed at ensuring full respect for the rights of individuals in line with the principles and provisions of international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law.

### Self Reliance

The ability of an individual, household or community to meet essential needs and to enjoy social and economic rights in a sustainable manner and with dignity.

## Gender Statistics

Gender statistics refer to statistics that adequately reflect differences and inequalities between women and men in all areas of life. Gender statistics are more than just statistics about women or sex-disaggregated data. They include:

·       Sex-disaggregated data;

·       Data pertaining specifically to women or men;

·       Data capturing gender issues, even if they do not explicitly mention gender, sex, or women and men.

### Gender

Gender is a socio-cultural construct that defines and determines the roles, responsibilities, entitlements, and limitations of women, men, girls, and boys in society. It influences their societal position and varies across time, space, and context. Gender refers to the roles and expectations assigned by society, not biology.

### Sex

Sex refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that distinguish females and males. These characteristics are natural, unlike gender, which is socially constructed and shaped by historical, cultural, and relational contexts.

### Gender Analysis

Gender analysis examines how differences in roles, responsibilities, needs, opportunities, and rights affect women, men, girls, and boys. It analyzes their constraints and the impacts of these differences to inform policies and programs. This analysis highlights gender gaps and supports equitable development planning.

### Gender Relations

These are socially constructed relationships between women and men in a given cultural context. They differ from biological distinctions and influence power dynamics, access to resources, and social positioning.

### Gender Issues

Gender issues refer to challenges, opportunities, and barriers affecting both women and men, girls and boys. They are not synonymous with women’s issues.

### Gender-Aware Planning

This is the process of incorporating gender considerations into planning and development initiatives. It acknowledges that programs affect women/girls and men/boys differently. The use of sex-disaggregated data is essential in policymaking, planning, budgeting, and decision-making.

### Gender Inequality

Gender inequality refers to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and benefits for women and men. It hinders individual development, national growth, and societal progress.

### Gender Statistics

Gender statistics reflect the socio-cultural realities of women, men, girls, and boys. They include sex-disaggregated data and other statistics relevant to gender-related issues.

### Sex-Disaggregated Data

Data categorized separately for males and females. This disaggregation is essential for identifying inequalities and conducting effective gender analysis.

### Gender-Disaggregated Data

Data that are broken down by sex and other variables such as age, location, ethnicity, disability, socio-economic status, and education. These distinctions help reveal hidden inequalities.

### Statistics on Women

Data focused exclusively on women, often used to highlight their situation. However, they do not allow for comparisons with men and cannot fully reveal gender gaps.

### Gender Bias

Bias arising from decisions or assumptions based on gender, often favoring men or boys over women or girls.

### Gender Stereotyping

Assigning specific attributes, characteristics, or roles to individuals solely based on their gender. Stereotyping becomes harmful when it limits opportunities or choices, particularly in education, careers, or personal development.

### Gender Equality

The condition in which women and men, girls and boys have equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities. Gender equality ensures that individuals can realize their full potential without discrimination based on gender.

### Gender Indicators

Measures used to assess progress toward gender equality. These may be quantitative (e.g., statistics, figures) or qualitative (e.g., perceptions, experiences).

### Gender Equity

The principle of fairness in treatment for women and men, accounting for different needs, interests, and experiences. It may require special measures to address historic or systemic disadvantages.

### Gender Gap

The measurable difference between women and men in terms of access to opportunities, resources, and participation in various sectors.

### Gender Disparities

Statistical differences, often called gaps, between men and women that reflect unequal conditions or outcomes.

### Gender Parity

Gender parity is a numerical measure that reflects relative equality in terms of the number and proportion of women and men, or girls and boys. It is commonly calculated as the ratio of female to male values for a given indicator. When the ratio is calculated as male to female instead, the term “sex ratio” is used rather than “gender parity.”

### Gender Parity Index

The Gender Parity Index (GPI) measures the relative access to education of female and male students. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of females to the number of males enrolled at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education.

### Gender Development Index (GDI)

The GDI is a tool used to measure gender inequalities in the social, cultural, economic, and political spheres. It assesses gender gaps in human development across three key dimensions:

1.       Health – measured by female and male life expectancy at birth;

2.     Education – measured by female and male expected years of schooling for children and mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 and above;

3.      Economic resources – measured by estimated earned income for females and males.

### Gender Blindness

Gender blindness refers to the failure to recognize that the roles and responsibilities of women/girls and men/boys are socially and culturally constructed. Gender-blind studies, programs, projects, policies, and attitudes maintain the status quo, overlooking diverse needs and roles, and therefore fail to transform unequal gender relations.

### Gender Roles

Gender roles are social and behavioral norms that a given culture considers appropriate for individuals of a specific sex. These roles often determine traditional tasks and responsibilities assigned to women, men, boys, and girls, and are shaped by factors such as household structure, access to resources, the global economy, conflict, disasters, and local ecological conditions.

### Gender Norms

Gender norms are the accepted attributes and behaviors associated with male and female identities in a specific society or community at a particular point in time. They establish standards and expectations of how men and women should act. Internalized early in life, gender norms influence lifelong gender socialization and stereotypes.

### Gender Planning

Gender planning is an approach that acknowledges the different roles of women and men in society and recognizes that their needs often differ.

### Strategic Gender Needs

These are the requirements necessary for women and men to improve their status or position in society. Addressing strategic gender needs enables individuals to move beyond restrictive social roles. For women, these needs may include land rights, decision-making power, equal pay, and access to credit.

### Gender Relations

Gender relations are a specific subset of social relations that define interactions between men and women as social groups. These relations intersect with other social influences—such as age, ethnicity, race, and religion—to shape individuals’ status and identity. As social constructs, gender relations can be changed.

### Gender Balance

Gender balance refers to equal participation of women and men in all areas of work and within programs initiated or supported by institutions. Achieving gender balance creates a more inclusive environment, enhances policy and program effectiveness, and strengthens institutional capacity to serve the entire population.

### Gender Accommodating

It’s the awareness of gender differences and the willingness to adjust and adapt policies, programs, or actions accordingly. It is closely related to gender sensitivity.

### Gender Perspective

Taking a gender perspective involves considering gender-based differences in any social phenomenon, policy, or process. It emphasizes differences in status and power and examines how gender-based discrimination shapes both immediate needs and long-term interests. In policymaking, a gender perspective ensures that women’s and men’s experiences are equally considered in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of programs and policies.

### Gender Mainstreaming

Gender mainstreaming is the systematic integration of a gender perspective into the preparation, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of policies, regulations, and spending programs, with the aim of promoting gender equality and eliminating discrimination.

### Gender Mainstreaming in Statistics

This involves the systematic consideration of gender issues and the elimination of gender-based bias throughout all stages of statistical production.

### Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)

All procedures involving the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.

### Domestic Violence

All acts of physical, sexual, psychological, or economic violence occurring within the family or domestic setting. This applies regardless of biological or legal ties and includes violence between current or former spouses or partners, whether or not they share a residence.

### Gender-Based Violence (GBV)

An umbrella term for any harmful act perpetrated against a person based on socially ascribed gender differences. GBV varies across cultures and regions and includes sexual violence, domestic violence, trafficking, forced or early marriage, harmful traditional practices (e.g., FGM, honor killings, widow inheritance), and more. These acts may occur in both public and private settings.

### Women’s Issues

These refer to the unique opportunities, challenges, and constraints that affect women and girls. Due to inadequate representation at decision-making levels, their needs are often overlooked or inadequately addressed.

### Women in Development (WID)

The WID approach highlights the marginalization of women in development processes. It advocates for the inclusion of women in development initiatives to ensure that they benefit equally from resources and interventions.

### Empowerment

Refers to enhancing the personal, political, social, or economic strength of individuals and communities. Women's empowerment enables them to gain control over their lives through increased awareness, confidence, choice, access to resources, and transformation of discriminatory structures and institutions.

### Women’s Economic Empowerment

Refers to enabling women to participate equally in and benefit from decent work, social protection, market access, and control over resources, time, and decision-making. It also involves increasing women's voice, agency, and participation in economic decisions at all levels, from the household to international institutions.

## Special Population Groups

### Person with Disability

A person with a disability is someone who has a long-term physical, psychological, intellectual, or sensory impairment which, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.

### Disability Cash Benefits

Disability cash benefits refer to financial payments made to individuals who are fully or partially unable to engage in gainful employment due to a disability. The disability may be congenital or acquired as a result of an accident or illness during the individual’s lifetime. These benefits do not include those resulting from prescribed industrial accidents or occupational diseases, which are classified under occupational injury and disease. The provision of goods and services in kind is categorized under services for the elderly and persons with disabilities.

### Stateless Persons

Stateless persons are individuals who are not recognized as nationals by any state under the operation of its laws; either because they never acquired a nationality or because they lost it without obtaining a new one.

### Stateless Population, *In Situ*

This refers to stateless individuals who have never crossed an international border but remain in their “own country”- a place where they have long-standing and significant ties, usually through birth or long-term residence. Their statelessness is often the result of shortcomings in the design or implementation of nationality laws.

### Indigenous Peoples

Indigenous peoples are communities, groups, or individuals who are descended from the original inhabitants of a country or region, and who retain distinct social, cultural, economic, and political characteristics. They often maintain their own languages, traditions, customs, and institutions and have a strong connection to ancestral lands and natural resources. Indigenous peoples typically identify themselves as such and are recognized by others as belonging to distinct cultural groups. Despite their diversity, they frequently face challenges related to marginalization, land rights, and preservation of cultural heritage.

### Guardian

A guardian is an independent adult who safeguards a child’s best interests and general well-being and complements the child’s limited legal capacity.

### Unaccompanied Child

An unaccompanied child is one who has been separated from both parents and other relatives and is not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so.

### Alternative Care (Child Protection)

Alternative care refers to arrangements made for children who are temporarily or permanently deprived of their family environment or whose best interests require placement outside their family.

### Best Interests of the Child Principle

As stated in Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC): “In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.”

### Justice for Children

Justice for children refers to a United Nations framework and set of guiding principles aimed at ensuring that justice systems better serve and protect children. It promotes full adherence to international norms and standards for all children who come into contact with justice or related systems, whether as victims, witnesses, alleged offenders, or for matters involving care, custody, or protection.

### Juvenile Justice

Juvenile justice is a justice system designed specifically for children or young persons who are considered juveniles under the respective legal system. It ensures that offenses committed by juveniles are addressed in a manner distinct from how adult offenses are treated. Age limits defining juveniles vary by country.

### Older Person

According to the United Nations, an older person is someone aged 60 years or older. However, in many communities, age is also determined by socio-cultural markers such as family status (e.g., being a grandparent), physical appearance (e.g., grey hair, wrinkles), or age-related health conditions.

### Youth

There is no universally agreed international definition of “youth.” For statistical purposes, however, the United Nations defines youth as individuals between the ages of 15 and 24 years, without prejudice to definitions adopted by individual Member States.

### Person of Concern

This term traditionally refers to all individuals for whom the UNHCR is mandated to provide protection, assistance, and durable solutions. It includes refugees, asylum-seekers, refugee returnees, stateless persons, and—in many situations—internally displaced persons (IDPs), including those supported by State and non-State partners.

## Living Conditions and Poverty

Living conditions are the circumstances or factors affecting the way in which people live, particularly with regard to their well-being. The term 'living conditions' is closely related to that of 'quality of life.

Poverty is a state or condition in which an individual lacks the financial resources and essentials for a basic standard of living.

### Welfare Analysis

Welfare analysis, in economics, is the study of how policies or market changes affect the well-being of individuals and society, primarily by measuring the net benefits to consumers and producers.

### Poverty

Poverty is a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, such as food, clean water, shelter, education, and healthcare (monetary and non-monetary). It typically results from a lack of access to resources or opportunities to improve one's economic situation. Poverty is often measured by income levels, with individuals or households falling below a certain income threshold considered to be in poverty. However, poverty also encompasses other dimensions, including social exclusion, lack of access to essential services, and limited opportunities for economic and social advancement.

### Household Expenditure

Household expenditure refers to the total spending by a person living alone or a group of people living together on goods and services within a specific time period.

### Household Consumption

Household consumption is the quantity of goods and services that the household enjoys in a given period.

### Household Consumption Expenditure

Household consumption expenditure includes those money outlays directed toward consumption (e.g., it excludes outlays for investment purposes).

### Data Used in Analysis

Data used in analysis refers to the specific information, collected and prepared, that is subjected to various techniques and methods to extract meaningful insights, support decision-making, and draw conclusions. It encompasses raw data that has been organized, cleaned, and potentially transformed to make it suitable for analysis.

### Recall Period

The recall period in an interview refers to the specific timeframe that respondents are asked to remember or reflect upon when providing information. It is a key aspect in survey design, especially in interviews related to data collection on behaviors, expenditures, or experiences.

In an interview about household income, the recall period might be "the last month" or "the past year," and respondents would be asked to report their income or expenditures during that specific period. The choice of recall period is important because it affects the accuracy and reliability of the responses. If the recall period is too long, respondents may forget details or provide inaccurate information. If it is too short, the information might not capture enough relevant data to make meaningful conclusions.

### -Day Recall Period

Recall interviews with a 7-day recall period are used for the collection of food consumption data, as this method provides a good balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

### 1-Month Recall Period

Recall interviews with a 1-month recall period are used for the collection of frequent non-food consumption data.

### 6-Month Recall Period

Recall interviews with a 6-month recall period are used for the collection of less frequent non-food consumption data.

### 1-Year Recall Period

Recall interviews with a 1-year recall period are used for the collection of durable goods consumption data.

### Nominal Consumption Aggregate (NCA)

The computation of a consumption-based welfare measure consists of assembling the so-called nominal consumption aggregate (NCA) from survey data. NCA is defined as the value of all goods and services consumed by members of the household during the reference period (see Household Consumption Expenditure).

### Modes of Acquisition

All surveys should collect data on all main modes of food acquisition, namely:\
 a) Purchases;\
 b) Household’s own production; and\
 c) Received in kind/gifts, etc.

### Household’s Own Production

Food from own production includes products usually sold as part of a household’s main commercial enterprise that are instead reserved for consumption (farm households are a typical example), as well as non-commercial and subsistence food production, and food acquired from hunting, fishing, and gathering.

### Food Received in Kind

Food received in kind in the form of transfers from other households, the private sector, or the government.

### Food Away from Home

“Food away from home” generally refers to food prepared away from home, regardless of whether the food is consumed outside or inside the home. This includes meals and snacks purchased from restaurants and other commercial establishments (including takeout meals), received in-kind at school, at work, from other households, etc.

### Non-Food Non-Durable Items

The non-food non-durable items of the non-food component of the NCA will include all the items in Division 03 “Clothing and Footwear” through to Category 13 “Personal Care, Social Protection, and Miscellaneous Goods,” referencing the Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP), the international reference classification of household expenditures (United Nations, 2018).

### Durable Goods (Items)

The durable goods/items of the non-food component of the NCA include those defined by their durability—meaning their ability to deliver useful services through repeated use over an extended period. Examples include automobiles, household appliances, and electronic devices.

### Hedonic Rent Imputation – Housing Component of the NCA

Hedonic rent imputation is a method used in economic analysis to estimate the value of housing or real estate, accounting for attributes that influence price, such as location, size, amenities, and condition. The “hedonic pricing model” assumes the price of a good (in this case, housing) is determined by the sum of the values of its individual characteristics.

### Adjusting for Price Variation

Adjusting for price variation refers to accounting for differences in prices over time or across locations when comparing economic data, such as income, expenditure, or living standards. This adjustment—using either Paasche or Laspeyres price deflators—eliminates the influence of price changes or regional disparities to enable like-for-like comparisons.

### Adjusting for Household Size and Composition

This refers to modifying economic indicators (such as income or expenditure) to account for differences in the number and characteristics of household members (e.g., age, gender) using equivalence scales or consumption needs.

### Poverty Profile

A description of how the extent of poverty varies across sub-groups of a given population, characterized by gender, geographical location, type of economic activity, income source, etc.

### Poverty Line

The poverty line is a monetary threshold determined at a specific time and location, representing the minimum level of income or consumption expenditure required to meet basic needs, including food, housing, clothing, and healthcare.

### The Food Poverty Line

The food poverty line represents the minimum monetary threshold in Kenyan Shillings required to meet nutritional needs based on consumption patterns. It is calculated based on food that provides 2,250 Kcal per adult equivalent per day, over a 30-day period.

### Absolute Poverty/Overall Poverty Line

The monetary threshold in Kenyan Shillings required to purchase a combination of food and non-food items per adult equivalent per month.

### Food Poverty

Individuals (or households, if estimated at the household level) whose food consumption per adult equivalent falls below the food poverty line in rural or urban areas are considered food poor or in "food poverty."

### Overall (Absolute) Poverty

Individuals (or households) whose total (food and non-food) consumption per adult equivalent falls below the overall poverty line are considered in "overall poverty."

### Hardcore (Extreme) Poverty

Individuals (or households) whose total consumption per adult equivalent is below the food poverty line are considered in "hardcore poverty."

### The Headcount Ratio (HCR or P~0~)/Headcount Ratio (H)

The proportion of individuals (or households) whose total consumption falls below the poverty line. It is the most commonly used measure of poverty due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation.

### Poverty Gap (P~1~)

The poverty gap index measures the average shortfall from the poverty line as a percentage. It reflects the mean distance of the poor from the poverty line, with those above the line considered to have zero shortfall. It also indicates the minimum cost to eliminate poverty under perfect targeting.

### Squared Poverty Gap/Severity of Poverty

This index squares each poverty gap before averaging, placing greater weight on the poorest. It accounts for inequality among the poor. Proposed by Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984), it is part of a class of poverty measures varying the weight of deprivation severity.

### The Gini Index

The Gini coefficient measures inequality in consumption expenditure. A value of 0 indicates perfect equality, while a value of 100 indicates maximum inequality (i.e., one individual has all the expenditure).

### Multidimensional Poverty

A measure of poverty that considers factors beyond income, such as education, health, and living standards.

## Climate Change

Climate change refers to any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended period of time. In other words, climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns, among others, that occur over several decades or longer. It is attributed directly or indirectly to human (anthropogenic) activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere. The term is frequently used in reference to global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.

### Climate

Refers to the condition of the atmosphere at a particular location (microclimate) or region over a long period of time. It is the long-term summation of atmospheric elements – such as solar radiation, temperature, humidity, precipitation type (frequency and amount), atmospheric pressure, and wind (speed and direction) – and their variations.

### Weather

Weather is the state of the atmosphere of a given place at a given time. The elements of weather include, but are not limited to, rainfall, temperature, pressure, wind, cloud cover, and humidity.

### Environment

The totality of all the external conditions (physical, biological, and socio-economic) affecting the life, development, and survival of an organism.

### Climate Model

A numerical representation of the climate system based on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of its components, their interactions, and feedback processes, and accounting for some of its known properties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for any one component or combination of components, a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical, chemical, or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the level at which empirical parametrizations are involved.

### Climate Prediction

A probabilistic statement about future climate conditions on timescales ranging from seasons to decades. It is based on conditions known at present and assumptions about the physical processes that will determine future changes. When a projection is branded "most likely," it becomes a prediction, and outputs of which can enable some level of confidence to be attached to projections.

### Climate Projection

The simulated response of the climate system to a scenario of future emissions or concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, generally derived using climate models. Projections provide a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Climate projections are distinguished from climate predictions by their dependence on the emission/concentration/radiative forcing scenario used, which is, in turn, based on assumptions concerning, for example, future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be realized.

Examples include geographic areas (state, county, school district, health service area), socio-demographic groups, or both (e.g., a specific age-sex-race group within a large geographic area), or other subpopulations (e.g., a set of firms belonging to a census division by industry group).

### Small Area Estimation

Small area estimation is a set of methods used to achieve estimates of acceptable quality for publication. As statistical information is disaggregated into smaller population subgroups, it becomes noisier and yields larger coefficients of variation (CV), which may exceed the threshold established by the National Statistical Offices (NSO), above which they may choose not to publish that specific estimate.

### Model-Based Small Area Estimates

Model-based small area estimates rely on statistical models to establish a relationship between a dependent variable and a set of covariates. The covariates and parameters obtained from the fitted model are then used to predict the dependent variable in the auxiliary data. In the context of small area estimates of poverty under unit-level models, the dependent variable is typically consumption, expenditure, or income, and the method relies on properly replicating the welfare distribution.

### Area-Level Models

In small area estimation methodologies, area-level models use only aggregate auxiliary information at the area level. Aggregated data are more readily available because they are typically not subject to confidentiality restrictions.

### Unit-Level Models

Unit-level models refer to models where detailed unit-record data are available—for example, detailed income/expenditure information from household surveys and a set of household-level characteristics available in both a household survey and a population census—to simulate household expenditures or incomes for each household in the population census data.

In operational terms, it is a regularly updated, structured database that contains organizational, administrative and statistical units describing businesses in a country or region, that is maintained by a dedicated staff, supported by a purpose-built software system and that is used by an NSO to create frames for business surveys and sometimes as a direct source of counts of businesses by type, size, geography, economic activity, etc.

#### Institutional unit

An entity that is capable, in its own right, of owning assets, incurring liabilities and engaging in economic activities and in transactions with other entities. There are two types of institutional units, namely legal entities and households.

#### Institutional sector

This is an aggregation of institutional units on the basis of the type of producer and depending on their principal activity and function, which are considered to be indicative of their economic behaviour. A sector is divided into sub-sectors according to the criteria relevant to that sector; this permits a more precise description of the economic behaviour of the unit.

#### 60301.3.1 Non-financial corporations

Are institutional units that are principally engaged in the production of market goods and non-financial services.

#### Financial corporations

Are institutional units that are principally engaged in the production of market financial services including financial intermediation. It also includes the central bank, even though the central bank mainly produces non-market output.

#### General government sector

It consists of the totality of institutional units which, in addition to fulfilling their political responsibilities and their role of economic regulation, produce principally non-market services (possible goods) for individual or collective consumption and redistribute income and wealth.

#### Households

Are institutional units consisting of one individual or a group of individuals. All physical persons in the economy must belong to one and only one household. The principal functions of households are to supply labour, to undertake final consumption and, as entrepreneurs, to produce market goods and non-financial (and possibly financial) services. The entrepreneurial activities of a household consist of unincorporated enterprises that remain within the household except under certain specific conditions.

####  Non-profit institutions serving households (N-PISHs)

Are legal entities that are principally engaged in the production of non-market services for households or the community at large and whose main resources are voluntary contributions.

#### Legal unit

This refers to any entity recognized by law as having rights and obligations. This includes *Legal persons* whose existence is recognised by law independently of the individuals or institutions which may own them or are members of them and *Natural persons* who are engaged in an economic activity in their own right.

#### Economic unit

An economic unit is an entity capable, in its own right, of owning goods or assets, incurring liabilities, and engaging in economic activities and transactions with other units.

#### Administrative unit

A geographic area that serves administrative and governmental functions. They are usually defined and established by legal action.

#### Operational unit

A unit defined by a legal unit for the purposes of organizing itself, for example a division, branch, workshop, warehouse, or outlet.

#### Statistical unit (SU)

#### Firm/Enterprise

A legal unit(or the smallest set of legal units) that produces goods or services and that hasautonomy with respect to financial and investmentdecision-making. An enterprise may be acorporation (or quasi-corporation), a non-profitinstitution, or an unincorporated enterprise. Anunincorporated enterprise is a household orgovernment unit in its capacity as a producer ofgoods or services.

#### Establishment

An enterprise or part of an enterprisethat is situated in a single location and in which onlya single (non-ancillary) productive activity is carriedout or in which the principal productive activityaccounts for most of the value added. An establishment is sometimes referred to as a “*Local Kind-of-Activity Unit (LKAU)”.*

#### Kind-of-Activity Unit (KAU)

an enterprise or part of an enterprisethat engages in only one kind ofproductive activity or in which the principalproductive activity accounts for most of the valueadded.As compared to the establishment, in the case of such a unit, there is no restriction on the geographic area in which the activity is carried out.

#### Local unit

An enterprise or a part of an enterprise (for example, a workshop, factory, warehouse, office, mine or depot) that engages in productive activity at or from one location.

####  Enterprise group

An association of enterprises bound together by legal and/or financial links and controlled by the group head. A group of enterprises can have more than one decision-making centre, especially for policy decisions on production, sales and profits. It may centralize certain aspects of financial management and taxation. It constitutes an economic entity which is empowered to make choices, particularly concerning the units which it comprises

#### Unincorporated enterprise

A producer unit which is not incorporated as a legal entity separate from the owner (household, government or foreign resident); the fixed and other assets used in unincorporated enterprises do not belong to the enterprises but to their owners, the enterprises as such cannot engage in transactions with other economic units nor can they enter into contractual relationships with other units nor incur liabilities on their own behalf; in addition, their owners are personally liable, without limit, for any debts or obligations incurred in the course of production.

#### Quasi-corporation

Unincorporated enterprises that function as if they were corporations, and which have complete sets of accounts, including balance sheets.

#### Enterprise Snapshot

A flat file extracted from the SBR at a given point in time containing every *enterprise* in the SBR together with the *data items* needed for survey ample selection.

#### A multinational enterprise group (MNE)

 It is defined as a group of enterprises or legal units that are controlled by a common parent and have business establishments in at least two different countries.

#### Truncated enterprise groups

It consists of the enterprises and the legal units of a multinational enterprise group, which are resident in the same country. It may comprise only one unit, if the other units are non-resident. An enterprise may be the truncated group or part thereof. A truncated group may consist of several units and subgroups, which can appear seemingly unlinked if their parent is non-resident, but actually belong to the same multinational enterprise.

#### All-resident groups

It consists exclusively of enterprises or legal units that are resident in the same country, regardless of their organizational or ownership links.

#### Legal status

Refers to the legal form or classification of an entity recognized by law, indicating its existence as a legal unit that can own property, enter contracts, incur liabilities, and be held responsible legally. It defines whether the entity is, for example, a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, sole proprietorship, or a natural person engaged in economic activity.

#### Sole Proprietorship

An enterprise owned exclusively by one natural person, where there is no legal distinction between the owner and the business entity. The owner personally assumes all rights and obligations of the business, and the enterprise is not constituted as a separate legal person.

#### Partnership

An association of two or more persons (or entities) who agree to combine their resources, labor, or skills to carry on a business and share its profits. It represents a cooperative relationship where the partners jointly manage the business, share risks, and benefits according to their agreement.

#### Local Private Company

A privately owned enterprise legally registered and operating within a single country, typically characterized by identity as a legal unit or enterprise that is resident and active under local laws and regulations. It excludes entities publicly owned or controlled by multinational groups and focuses on private, often smaller-scale business units serving local or national markets.

#### Nonprofit Organizations/Institutions 

Are legal or social entities created for the purpose of producing goods and services but whose status does not permit them to be a source of income, profit or other financial gain for the units that establish, control or finance them.

#### Faith Based Organization

Are non-profit entities that are affiliated with religious institutions and provide various social services, often seeking to integrate their spiritual values into their community outreach efforts

#### Community Based Organizations

These are membership-based local groups formed by residents of a community to address issues of concern to that community.

#### Formal sector

The formal sector is composed of all enterprises which are incorporated or otherwise registered under national legislation, including factories, offices, shops, farms, and other units engaged in the production of goods or services for sale or barter.

#### Informal sector

The set of non-agricultural household enterprises that have market production but that are not registered with the administrative sources on which the SBR is based.

#### Profiling

The process of delineating the statistical units within an enterprise group.

#### Profile Group

Group of *enterprises* that need to be profiled as a group rather than individually because of ownership and control.

#### Profiling Maintenance Group

#### Registered Name of Business

This refers to the name, description or style under which a business is carried as registered with the registrar of companies in terms of the Registration of Business Names Act.

#### Shareholder

Any person, company, or any other legal entity that owns at least one share in a company. A shareholder may also be referred to as a stockholder. Shareholders are the owners of the company. They have the potential to profit if the company does well, but that comes with the potential to lose if the company does poorly. A shareholder can also be someone who holds shares of stock in a corporation.

#### Statutory Corporation

An organisation established by an Act of Parliament, which is neither a Public Limited Company nor a Department of the Public Service under leadership of a Board or Trust that is responsible or answerable to a given Ministry of the State.

#### Trading Name

This is the name under which a business operates in the market and may differ from the legal name. Both company name and trading name are registered at Registrar of companies.

#### Business population

All firms in the business sector, which can be disaggregated by economic activity and size.

#### Activity

A process, or a combination of actions that result in a certain set of products. Activities are defined as the use of inputs (e.g. capital, labour, energy, and materials) to produce outputs. The outputs that result from undertaking activities can be transferred or sold to other units (in market or non-market transactions), placed in inventory or used by the producing units for own final use.

#### Secondary activity

Separate activity that produces products eventually for third parties and that is not the principal activity of the unit in question. The outputs of secondary activities are secondary products. Most economic entities produce at least some secondary products.

#### Principal activity

The activity which contributes most to the total value added of the unit under consideration. Ideally, the principal activity of the unit should be determined with reference to the value added to the goods and services produced, by applying the top-down method.

#### Ancillary activity

###### Activities are undertaken to support principal and secondary productive activities of a unit by providing goods or services entirely or primarily for the use of that entity, such as bookkeeping, transportation, storage, purchasing, sales promotion, cleaning, repair and maintenance, security etc. The output is always intended for intermediate consumption within the same unit and is therefore usually not recorded separately.

#### Number of employees

Those persons who work for an employer and who have a contract of employment and receive compensation in the form of wages, salaries, fees, gratuities, piecework pay or remuneration in kind. A worker from an employment agency is considered to be an employee of that employment agency and not of the units in which he or she works, including temporarily.

#### Historical register

###### A version of the register with the capacity to view the content of a live register at some time point in the past.

#### Frozen frame

A subset of the snapshot that comprises all statistical units that are active, or potentially active, or active within the previous reference year. It also includes administrative units that are linked to these statistical units. It contains all the active statistical units in a snapshot that have sufficient information associated with them for sample selection purposes.

#### Domestically controlled enterprise group

###### A multinational group where the global decision-centre is in the country compiling the business register.

#### Death of an enterprise

The dissolution of a combination of production factors with the restriction that no other enterprises are involved in the event. Deaths do not include exits from the population due to mergers, take-overs, break-ups or restructuring of a set of enterprises. It does not include exits from a sub-population resulting only from a change of activity.

#### Death of an enterprise group

The cessation of all control links, direct or indirect, between the legal units of which the enterprise group consists. The legal units become independent again or cease to exist. No other enterprise group is involved. Death applies only to all-resident and multinational groups, not to truncated groups, which cease to exist through other events.

#### Control

###### A single institutional unit owning more than a half of the shares, or equity, of a corporation is able to control its policy and operations by outvoting all other shareholders, if necessary. Similarly, a small, organized group of shareholders whose combined ownership of shares exceeds 50 per cent of the total is able to control the corporation by acting in concert.

#### Characteristic/Variable

###### A set of information that is stored in a business register to describe a statistical unit. Characteristics are provided for identification of a unit like name, address, and identification numbers, for economic description of a unit, like activity code, turnover or employment of a unit or for the structure of a unit, like the relationship to other statistical units.

#### Birth (of enterprise group)

###### The establishing of a link of control, direct or indirect, between two or more independent legal units, where no link of control existed before and no other enterprise group is involved.

#### Birth (of enterprise)

###### The creation of a combination of production factors with the restriction that no other enterprises are involved in the event. Births do not include creation of entries into the population due to mergers, break-ups, split-off or restructuring of a set of enterprises. It does not include entries into a sub-population resulting only from a change of activity. A birth means the enterprise starts from scratch and actually starts activity. An enterprise creation can be considered as an enterprise birth if new production factors, in particular new jobs, are created. If a dormant unit is reactivated within two years, this event is not considered a birth.

####  Registers of population

An individualized data system, that is, a mechanism of continuous recording, and/or of coordinated linkage, of selected information pertaining to each member of the resident population of a country in such a way to provide the possibility of determining up-to-date information concerning the size and characteristics of that population at selected time intervals.

#### Registers of dwellings and buildings

Referred to in some countries as real estate registers are registers usually held by land and property valuation agencies, land survey authorities or by local or municipal authorities responsible for the development of housing policies and urban planning. With respect to a register-based population census such registers are of fundamental importance in the harmonisation of the population register, in that every person that is allocated a dwelling number can be associated with a particular housing unit, and (in some cases) a distinct household. 

####  Agricultural registers

An up-to-date, continuously maintained list of agricultural holdings and their characteristics, including information on holders, land use, livestock, crops, machinery, labour force and other relevant variables, used to support the design of agricultural censuses, surveys and statistical programs.

### Population and housing censuses

#### Population Census

A population census is the total process of planning, collecting, compiling, evaluating, disseminating and analysing demographic, economic and social data at the smallest relevant geographical level pertaining, at a specified time, to all persons in a country or in a well-delimited part of a country.

#### Housing censuses

A housing census is (similarly) the total process of planning, collecting, compiling, evaluating, disseminating and analysing statistical data relating to the number and condition of housing units and facilities as available to the households pertaining, at a specified time, to all living quarters and its occupants in a country or in a well-delimited part of a country.

#### Base register

A register that holds the basic information relating to the stock of the entire set of ‘population’ units that are being counted in the census – typically persons, dwellings and buildings.

#### A centralised population register

A network of local registers that are linked in a coordinated way. Although the national population register may be a virtual entity based on the linkage of population registers established at the local level (decentralized system), the overall geographical coverage must be of the entire territory of the country.

### Business and agricultural censuses

#### Economic census

A complete enumeration of all economic establishments engaged in production and/or distribution of goods and services within a country or territory, at a specified point or period in time.

#### Agricultural Census/Census of Agriculture:

A statistical operation for collecting, processing and disseminating data on the structure of agriculture, covering the whole or a significant part of the country.

### Household and individual surveys

#### Household survey

A household survey is a method of data collection in which information is collected from a sample of households, usually using face-to-face interviews, postal questionnaires, or telephone interviews.

#### Area sampling

A probability sampling method in which geographical areas are used as the primary sampling units, and samples are selected by first dividing the population into geographic units (such as blocks, villages, or enumeration areas) and then sampling within these areas.

#### List sampling

List sampling is a probability sampling method in which the sampling frame is a complete, up-to-date list of all units in the target population, and units are selected directly from this list using random or systematic methods.

#### Clustering

Clustering means dividing the population into naturally occurring or practical groups (clusters) — like villages, city blocks, or schools.

#### Cluster sampling

A sampling method in which the population is divided into clusters and a sample of these clusters is selected. Either all units within each selected cluster are observed or a sample of units within each cluster is selected.

#### Cluster size

The number of sampling units included in a single cluster in a cluster sampling design.

#### Compact cluster

A small area such as an EA in which a fixed number of households is selected and enumerated. Compact clusters are used to ensure that households are near each other, making fieldwork practical and economical

#### Non‑compact cluster

A cluster in which the sampling units (e.g., households, dwellings, farms) are not physically concentrated in a small, contiguous area, but are instead spread out or dispersed over a wider geographical area.

#### Complex sample design

A survey sampling design that includes features such as stratification, clustering, multi-stage selection, or unequal selection probabilities to improve efficiency, precision, and feasibility compared to simple random sampling.

#### Confidence level

The degree of statistical confidence with which precision or margin of error around the survey estimate is obtained. The 95 per cent confidence level is generally regarded as the standard.

#### Design effect (deff)

A measure of efficiency of a complex sampling procedure compared to simple random sampling, defined as the ratio between the standard error using the given sample design and the standard error that would result if a simple random sample had been used.

#### Survey domain

A sub-population for which separate estimation of the main indicators is required/or is to be provided.

#### Estimator

A rule or method of estimating a parameter of a population.  It is usually expressed as a function of sample values and hence is a variable whose distribution is of great importance in assessing the reliability of the estimate to which it leads.

#### Stratification

The process by which the survey population is divided into subgroups or strata that are as homogeneous as possible based on certain criteria. The principal objective of stratification is to reduce sampling errors.

#### Explicitstratification

The actual process of dividing the sampling units into specified strata.

#### Implicit stratification

Stratifying of a sample frame through geographic sorting , coupled with systematic sampling to achieve the effect of stratification.

#### Intra‑class correlation

A statistical measure used in cluster sampling to show how strongly units within the same cluster resemble each other.

#### Master sample

A large sample drawn from a census frame and prepared for use in a number of surveys, from which sub-samples can be selected for specific surveys.

#### Measure of size (MOS)

The measure of size is an auxiliary variable, such as the number of households or population of an area, used to assign probabilities of selection for sampling units. For example, the number of households in an EA.

#### Probability Sampling

Sample selection method in which the units are selected randomly with known and nonzero probabilities. This is the only way to obtain unbiased estimates and to be able to measure the precision of the survey indicators by estimating the sampling errors.

#### Non‑probability sampling

Sampling method in which the units are selected subjectively (non-random). Examples of non-probability sampling methods include: quota, judgmental, purposive, convenience, random walk sampling.

#### Non‑sampling error

Errors in estimates which arise from sources other than sampling variation. Examples include coverage errors, response errors, non-response errors, and processing errors.

#### Content errors

Theseare errors in the characteristics of persons counted, resulting from incorrect reporting or recording or from failure to report.

#### Coverage errors

These are non-sampling errors that result from omitting a unit that should have been included, including a unit more than once, or including a unit that should not have been included.

#### Sampled population (or survey population)

The population that is actually covered by the sampling frame is called the survey population or sampled population.

#### Sample

Subset of units, selected from a frame for the purpose of collecting information from those units. The inference about the population as a whole is drawn from the findings based on that sample.

#### Sampling unit

The unit of selection at each stage of the sampling process, each unit being regarded as individual and indivisible when the selection is made.

#### Primary sampling unit (PSU)

The sampling unit for the first stage of selection in a multi-stage sampling procedure, typically a geographically defined unit such as an enumeration area (EA) or a segment of an EA.

#### Secondary sampling unit (SSU)

A unit selected in the second stage of a multi-stage sampling process. The SSU is chosen within each selected Primary Sampling Unit (PSU).

#### Sample take

The number of ultimate units to be selected within each selected PSU.

#### Probability sample

A sample in which the units are selected randomly with known and nonzero probabilities.

#### Quick counting

A rapid, short-duration exercise to collect preliminary, indicative, or basic data such as measure of size.

#### Reliability (precision, margin of error)

Closeness of the initial estimated value to the subsequent estimated value.

#### Sampling frame

A complete list of all sampling units that entirely covers the target population and is used as a basis for sampling.

#### Frame data (items)

The attributes of units of which the frame is composed, enabling the relevant population for the survey to be identified and stratified for sampling purposes, the sample to be selected, and the observation units to be identified and contacted for data.

#### Sampling fraction

The ratio of sample size to the total number of population size/units.

#### Sample size

The number of sampling units selected or surveyed from the population.

#### Sampling error

Random error in survey estimate due to the fact that a sample rather than the entire population is surveyed; square root of sampling variance.

#### Standard error (SE)

The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic, or representative error due to sampling.

#### Relative standard error (RSE)

The amount of sampling error relative to the indicator level, independent of the scale of the indicator, calculated by dividing the standard error by the estimated value of the indicator.

#### Multi-stage sampling

Process of selecting sampling units in stages with units at each stage being sub-sampled from the (larger) units chosen at the previous stage.

#### Sampling in phases

A sampling procedure in which the sample is selected in phases. In the first phase, a large sample is selected to obtain preliminary information, and in the second phase, a subsample of the initial sample is selected for more detailed information.

#### Design weight

The basic weight assigned to each unit in the sample, equal to the inverse of its probability of selection according to the survey design.

#### Sampling weight

The sampling weight (or survey weight) of a sampling unit is the design weight corrected for non-response or other calibrations like poststratification.

#### Poststratification

A statistical adjustment method applied to survey weights after data collection to align the survey estimates with known population totals for certain key variables (like age, sex, or region).

#### Self-weighting sample

A sample is self-weighting if every sampling unit has the same selection probability and hence the same sampling weight.

#### Sampling variance

The sampling variance of an estimate is the variance of the estimator over all possible samples that could be selected using the same sampling design.

#### Sampling with probability proportionate to size (PPS)

A sampling procedure in which the probability of selecting a sampling unit (such as an enumeration area, cluster, or establishment) is directly proportional to a known measure of its size (e.g., number of households, population, or employees), ensuring that each final element in the population has an equal chance of selection.

#### Self‑weighting Sample design

A sample design in which every unit in the target population has an equal probability of selection, resulting in identical design weights for all sampled units. This ensures that each unit represents the same number of units in the population, simplifying estimation and analysis by removing the need for unequal weighting adjustments.

#### Simple random sample (SRS)

A sample in which each unit of the population has the same probability of inclusion and each possible sample of a given size has the same probability of being selected.

#### Stratified sampling

A probability sampling method in which the population is divided into distinct subgroups, or strata, that are internally homogeneous with respect to certain characteristics but differ across strata. Independent samples are then drawn from each stratum according to specified allocation rules. This approach improves the precision of survey estimates and ensures adequate representation of key subpopulations.

#### Segmentation

A procedure used in multi-stage sampling designs where a selected primary sampling unit (such as an enumeration area or village) is subdivided into smaller, approximately equal parts called segments. One or more segments are then randomly selected for listing. Segmentation ensures manageable fieldwork and maintains equal selection probabilities within large sampling units.

#### Systematic sampling

A probability sampling method in which units are selected at regular intervals from an ordered sampling frame after the random selection of a starting point within the first interval.

#### Target population

The entire group of units about which survey information is required and to which the survey estimates are intended to apply. The target population should be clearly defined in terms of time, geography, and population characteristics to guide sampling design and ensure relevant, representative results.

#### Unit non-response

The situation in which a selected unit in the sample, such as a household, individual, or establishment, does not provide any usable information for the survey. Unit non-response can arise due to refusal, absence, or inability to contact the unit.

#### Item non-response

The type of nonresponse in which some questions, but not all, are answered for a particular sampling unit.

#### Household listing

A field-based activity in which all households and dwellings within a selected area, such as an enumeration area or segment, are systematically identified and recorded to create an up-to-date sampling frame for selecting the final sample units for a household survey.

#### Gross response rate

The number of respondents/units who complete a questionnaire divided the number of units in the sample, usually expressed as a percentage.

#### Net response rate

The number of respondents/units interviewed divided by the number eligible respondents/units for the survey.

#### Variance

A measure expressing the extent to which the values of a variable differ from the mean of the variable.

#### Cross-Sectional Survey

A type of survey that collects data on variables of interest at a single point in time, without following the same units over time. It provides a “snapshot” of the population’s characteristics, behaviours, or conditions at that specific time.

#### Longitudinal (Panel) Survey

A survey in which data is collected on the variables of interest from the same sample repeatedly over a period of time in order to study the changes over time.

#### Sample Design

The plan for selecting a sample from a population, including the definition of the sampling frame, the sample size, the sampling method, and the procedures for selecting the sample units.

#### Survey Design

A structured plan outlining how a survey’s target population will be sampled and how data will be collected and processed to produce accurate, reliable, and representative official statistics.  It includes sample design plus questionnaire design, data collection mode, fieldwork procedures and processing plan.

#### Survey Methodology

The set of methods and principles used to produce statistics, including the design, data collection, processing, estimation, validation, and dissemination phases.  It covers survey design plus all supporting methods like error measurement, editing, coding, imputation, weighting, estimation, variance estimation, quality assurance, and documentation.

#### Out of scope units

Units that do not fall within the defined population (target population) for which data are to be collected or estimates to be produced.

#### Outlier

An observation that differs significantly from other data points in a dataset and may unduly influence statistical estimates if not properly identified and treated.

#### Respondent

A person or people who provide responses/information to an interview either for themselves or on behalf of others. 

#### Response bias

A type of bias that occurs when respondents provide inaccurate answers, either intentionally or unintentionally, leading to systematic error in the survey results

#### Statistic

A numerical value calculated from data collected through censuses, surveys, or other sources, which describes, summarises, or estimates a specific characteristic of a population or sample.

#### Confidentiality

Refers to the legal and ethical obligations principles that ensure that information is not disclosed in a form that permits the identification of a statistical unit and is strictly used for statistical purposes.

#### Statistical Data

Statistical data refers to data from a survey or administrative source used to produce statistics

### Business and agricultural surveys

#### Arable land

Land under temporary agricultural crops, temporary meadows for mowing or pasture, land under market and kitchen gardens and land temporarily fallow (less than five years).

#### Area harvested

The technique uses high-frequency indicators, incorporates data like surveys, industrial production, or social media trends to infer low-frequency outcomes (e.g., quarterly GDP). It adjusts for reporting delays especially useful in public health and economics where official data lags behind real-world events**.**

Is an iterative design process that focuses on understanding and meeting the needs of the end-users, ensuring usability and accessibility.

### Open Data Portal (ODP)

Is an online portal that provides public access to datasets and resources, promoting transparency, collaboration, and evidence-based decision-making.

### Data Warehousing

The process of collecting, integrating, storing, and managing large volumes of data from multiple sources in a centralized repository designed for analysis, reporting, and decision-making. It ensures data is organized around key themes (e.g. health, education, finance); it is integrated; combines data from diverse sources into a consistent format; is time-Variant; there is storage of historical data to support trend analysis and forecasting. It also ensures data remains stable once entered, it is rarely changed or deleted.

### Footnote

A footnote is a note or other text located at the bottom of a page of text, manuscript, book or statistical tabulation that provides comment on or cites a reference for a designated part of the text or table

### Gateway

### Release

Dissemination activity by which official statistics become publicly known for the first time.

### Release calendar

Pre-defined schedule when key indicators and datasets are planned to be released at regular intervals and/or on given dates.

### Statistical Resource centre

A reference centre for all resourceful official statistical publications and information resources.

### Data portal

Web-based interface designed to make it easier to find data.

### Institutional Repository (IR)

A digital archive for collecting, preserving, and disseminating digital copies of the intellectual output of an institution

### Aggregate Data

Summarized data points, often across groups or categories

### Timeliness

The speed at which data are made available after collection.

### Accessibility

The ease with which data can be obtained and used by stakeholders.

### Interpretability

Degree to which data and results can be understood by the intended audience.

### Data Narratives

Contextual explanations that guide users through the implications and relevance of statistics

### Confidentiality Protection

Techniques (e.g. data masking, suppression) that prevent disclosure of individual identities.

### Communication

Process of transmitting information, ideas, or messages between individuals or groups. It can be verbal, non-verbal, written, or visual; and it can involve a wide variety of tools and methods. Communication aims to ensure that a message is understood by the recipient.

### Data communication

Involves the presentation, interpretation, and explanation of statistics to diverse audiences.

### Verbal communication

The use of spoken or written words to express thoughts, ideas, or emotions where language serves as the main medium of communication.

### Non-verbal communication

Communication that happens without the use of a linguistic system e.g. using body language, touch, and facial expressions.

### Written Communication

The exchange of information, ideas, or messages through written language in the form of letters, emails, notes, and more.

### Visual Communication

The transmission of information and ideas using symbols and imagery.

### Communication Tools

Range of methods of transmitting information from sender to a receiver. Includes mail, email, intranet,  telephones, SMS/text messaging, cellular and data plans, video and web conferencing, social networking sites, online collaboration/productivity (e.g. google workspace), file sharing tools such as drop-box, blogs, podcasts,  among others.

### Communication Policy

A communication policy is a set of guidelines and rules established by an organization to regulate the distribution of information both internally among employees and externally to stakeholders.
