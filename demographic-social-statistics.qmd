# Demographic and social statistics

## Population

Population refers to the totality of all units of interest in a study or investigation at a given time in a given area.

### Abortion

 Abortion is defined, with reference to the woman, as any interruption of pregnancy before 28 weeks of gestation with a dead foetus. There are two major categories of abortion: spontaneous and induced. Induced abortions are those initiated by deliberate action undertaken with the intention of terminating pregnancy; all other abortions are considered spontaneous.

### Adoption

Adoption is the legal and voluntary taking and treating of the child of other parents as one's own in so far as provided by the laws of the country. By means of a judicial process, whether related or not to the adopter, the adopted child acquires the rights and status of a legitimate child.

### Age dependency ratio

Agedependency ratios give the number of economically inactive people in relation to each economically active person. Classifications of economically active and inactive are usually made on the basis of age, with everyone aged less than 15 and everyone aged 65 and over considered economically inactive. The overall dependency ratio can be broken down into constituent parts, giving the child dependency ratio (number of children in relation to each economically active person) and the old-age dependency ratio (number of people aged 65 and over in relation to each economically active person).

### Age misreporting

This is the misreporting/mistating of a person's age by giving a value which is less or more than actual, either intentionally or unintentionally.

### Age ratio

It is the proportion of population in a given age group to its adjacent age groups, that is the successive and the preceding age groups.

### Age

Age is the interval of time between the day, month and year of birth and the day, month and year of occurrence of the event expressed in the largest completed unit of solar time such as years for adults and children and months, weeks, days, hours or minutes of life, as appropriate, for infants under one year of age.

### Age-sex accuracy index

It is an index that combines both the sex ratio and the age ratio for both males and females to generate a joint score. The score is used to evaluate the quality of age and sex data in population censuses or surveys.

### Age-Specific Fertility Rate

 Refers to the annual number of births to women of a specified age or age group per 1,000 women in that age group.

### Annulment of a marriage

The invalidation or voiding of a marriage by a competent authority, according to the laws of each country, which confers on the parties the status of never having been married to each other.

### Base population

It is the starting or reference population on which population projections are based. In most cases the enumerated population is used as a base population.

### Birth (or parity) order

Birth (or parity) order refers to the numerical order of the live birth or foetal death, recorded in relation to all previous pregnancy outcomes of the mother, irrespective of whether the outcome is a live birth or foetal death or whether pregnancies were nuptial or extranuptial.

### Birth registration

Refers to the process of recording a child's birth. It is a permanent and official record of a child's existence and provides legal recognition of that child's identity. It establishes a legal record of where the child was born and who the child's parents are.

### Burial permit

A burial permit is an official statement authorising the removal of the dead body (corpse) to the cemetery.

### Child Headed Household

A household whose head and main decision maker or source of livelihood is below the age of 18 years.

### Children Ever Born (CEB)

Refers to the life-time fertility experience of women 12 years and above. It is the total number of children a woman has given birth to in her lifetime.

### Cohort

A cohort is a group of people who experienced the same demographic event during a particular period of time. This will most commonly refer to births during a set period of time, but may also refer to marriages, onset of puberty, migration, first birth etc.

### Completeness of registration of a vital event

This is the proportion of vital events that are registered. It is the number of registered vital events divided by an estimate of the actual number of vital events that occurred in the same population during a specific period of time.

### Content errors

These are errors in the characteristics of persons counted, resulting from incorrect reporting or recording or from failure to report.

### Coverage errors

These are non-sampling errors that result from omitting a unit that should have been included, including a unit more than once, or including a unit that should not have been included.

### Crude divorce rate

The crude divorce rate is the number of divorces occurring among the population of a given geographical area during a given year, per 1,000 mid-year total population of the given geographical area during the same year.

### Crude marriage rate

The crude marriage rate is the number of marriages occurring among the population of a given geographical area during a given year, per 1,000 mid-year total population of the given geographical area during the same year.

### Current Fertility

Refers to births that occurred to a woman in the 12 months before the census or survey date.

### Date of birth

 The date of birth is the hour (minute), day, month and year of birth established in order that exact age may be determined in completed years, months, days, hours (minutes) of life as required.

### De facto population

 De facto population consists of all persons who are physically present in the country or area of enumeration at the population and housing census enumeration reference date, whether or not they are usual residents.

### De jure population

De jure population consists of all usual residents, whether or not they are present at the time of the population and housing census enumeration.

### Death

Death is the permanent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after the occurrence of live birth, i.e., the postnatal cessation of vital functions without capability of resuscitation. This definition excludes foetal deaths.

### Defacto female headed household

Is the household where the husband is not present and the wife becomes the main decision maker in his absence during a survey or census data collection exercise.

### Defacto Population Census

The collection of basic social, demographic and economic data for all people who will have spent a specified night in the reference area. A de facto census involves counting people who spent a specified night in a household or an institution.

### Dejure female headed household

Is the household where the main decision maker is a female who has never been married or is divorced or is legally separated or widowed during a data collection exercise.

### Dejure Population Census

The collection of basic social, demographic and economic data for all the people who normally reside in the country. It will exclude visitors from other countries and include residents who will be outside the country at the time of enumeration. At household or institution level the dejure census includes only the usual members. The problem with the dejure census is to define the "usual member" of a household or an institution.

### Delayed Registration of a vital event

The registration of a vital event after the prescribed period denoted in existing laws, rules, or regulations (including any grace period, if one is specified). A late registration is the registration of a vital event after the prescribed time period but within a specified grace period. In Kenya, the grace period is from the third to sixth month following the event.

### Demographic transition

The demographic transition is the process by which populations move from high mortality and fertility rates to low mortality and fertility rates as a country develops from a pre-industrial to an industrialized economic system. This is typically demonstrated through a demographic transition model. As fertility decline often lags behind mortality decline, there is an intermediate phase in the middle of the transition characterised by high growth rates.

### Divorce

Divorce is the final legal dissolution of a marriage; a separation of husband and wife that confers on the parties the right to remarriage under civil, religious and/or other provisions in accordance with the laws of the country.

### Dual events

Are those occurring simultaneously in the lives of two individuals, which cannot occur again in the life of either individual without a previous change to his or her status. Those events include marriage, registered partnership, separation, divorce, legal dissolution of registered partnerships and annulment of marriage.

### Dual records system

A dual records system is the simultaneous collection of vital events, mainly births and deaths and the appropriate exposed-to-the-risk population, by two collecting methods which, ideally, are independent of each other:

a\) a continuous vital event recording procedure which may be other than the civil registration system; and

b\) a periodic household sample survey conducted in the same geographical area.

Matching of the events reported by the two procedures provides methods of improving the estimate of the total number of vital events.

### Duration of marriage

The duration of a marriage refers to the interval of time between the day, month and year of marriage to date. It is often expressed in completed years.

### Dwelling Unit

This is a place of abode or residence with a private entrance. There can be many dwelling units within a structure. A dwelling unit may have one or more habitable rooms.

### Foetal Death

Foetal Death is death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the period of gestation. Death is indicated by the fact that after such separation, the foetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.

### Habitable Rooms

Habitable rooms are defined as places/spaces in the dwelling unit that are used mainly for living and exclude stores, granaries, offices, toilets and garages.

### Head of Household

Is the most responsible member of a household who makes key decisions of the household on a day-to-day basis and whose authority is recognized by all members of the household. It could be the father, mother or a child, or any other responsible member within the household.

### Homestead

It is an isolated compound with one or more structures, and may be inhabited by one or more households. In most cases, fences, hedges, walls, etc. surround homesteads. A homestead may contain, for example, a hut or a group of huts. A manyatta, thus is considered as a homestead. However, a wall/fence or hedge need not necessarily surround a homestead. For instance, boys' quarters, garage, kitchen, etc. may be part of a homestead whether or not they are surrounded by a fence/wall, etc.

### Household Member

A person who normally lives in a household and is either present or temporarily away from the household for a period of less than six months at the time of enumeration. This excludes visitors.

### Household

Is a person or a group of persons who reside in the same homestead or compound but not necessarily in the same dwelling unit. They have the same cooking arrangement and are answerable to the same household head.

### Housing census

A housing census is the total process of planning, collecting, processing, analysing, disseminating and evaluating statistical data relating to the number and condition of housing units and facilities as available to the households pertaining, at a specified time, to all living quarters and occupants thereof in a country or in a well-delimited part of a country.

### Illegitimate child

An illegitimate child is the child of parents who, according to national law or customs, were not married at the time of its birth.

### Judicial (legal) separation

A judicial (legal) separation is the disunion of married persons according to the laws of each country, without conferring on the parties the right to remarriage.

### Late Registration of a vital event

A late registration is the registration of a birth or death after the legally specified time period but within a specified grace period. The grace period is usually considered to be six months after the vital event.

### Legitimation

The formal investing of a person with the status and rights of a person born in wedlock, according to the laws of each country.

### Lifetime Fertility

Refers to the total number of children ever born alive during the entire reproductive period of the woman.

### Live Birth

Live Birth is the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which after such separation breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached; each product of such a birth is considered live-born.

### Male Headed Household

A household whose primary decision-maker or source of livelihood (income) is a man.

### Marriage

An act, ceremony or process by which the legal relationship of spouses is constituted. The legality of the union may be established by civil, religious or other means as recognized by the laws of each country. Countries may wish to expand the definition to cover civil unions if they are registered. In that case, registered partnership usually refers to a legal construct, entailing registration with the public authorities according to the laws of each country, that becomes the basis for legal conjugal obligations between two persons.

Matching of the events reported by the two procedures provides methods of improving the estimate of the total number of vital events.

### Medium-size Urban Centres

These are centres with a population of more than 10,000 but less than 100,000 people.

### Nuptiality

Refers to the frequency of marriages between persons of opposite sexes which involve rights and obligations fixed by law or custom.

### Population Change

The increase or decrease of the total population or one of its structural units within a given time interval. The components of change in total population are births, deaths and migration.

### Population Density

Population density is calculated as the total population divided by the total area which that population resides in. It provides a simple measure of the pressure of population on space and resources. Problems may arise when population density is calculated for countries with large areas which are uninhabitable, as it may give an impression of "emptiness" when actually the population is crowded in small areas within the total territory.

### Population Distribution

The arrangement of the population in space at a given time, that is geographically or among the various types of residential areas.

### Population Projection

It is an estimate of future population by considering changes in a population due to fertility (births), mortality (deaths) and migration.

### Population Pyramid

A diagram showing the comparison of a human population by sex and age at a given time, consisting of a pair of histograms, one for each sex, laid horizontally in ascending order of age groups with a common base. The diagram is intended to provide a quick overall comparison of the age and sex structure of the population.

### Population Size

### Population/Demographic Momentum

Population momentum refers to the inbuilt potential for growth (or decline) inherent in a population’s age-sex structure. It is the amount a population would increase (or decrease) in size, if the fertility of the population changed immediately to replacement level.

### Recognition

Is the legal acknowledgement, either voluntarily or compulsorily, of the paternity of a child born out of wedlock.

### Smoothed population

It is the population that has been adjusted for errors on age due to misreporting to give a more fitting demographic pattern.

### Structure

### Vital statistics system

In the context of defining a system as a set of interacting or independent components forming an integrating whole and for the purposes of these principles and recommendations, the vital statistics system's components are (a) legal registration, (b) statistical reporting of, and (c) collection, compilation, and dissemination of statistics pertaining to vital events. The vital events of interest are live births, adoptions, legitimations, recognition; deaths and fetal deaths; and marriages, divorces, separations, and annulments of marriage.

### Vital statistics

## Labour

### Core Labour Force Concepts & Status

#### Industry

A group of economic producing units (establishments or enterprises) that are primarily engaged in the same or similar kinds of productive activity.

#### Job

A set of tasks and duties performed or meant to be performed by one person for a single economic unit.

#### Occupation

A set of similar tasks or duties performed by a person in employment.

#### Work

Any activity (irrespective of legality, formal/informal nature, and consistent with the scope of productive activities within the SNA general production boundary) performed by a person of any sex and age to produce goods or provide services for use by others or for own use.

#### Employment (Work for pay or profit)

Work performed for others in exchange for pay (in cash or in kind) or profit. This is the traditional focus of labour force statistics. e.g. Employees (permanent, temporary, casual), self-employed individuals (employers, own-account workers), contributing family workers who receive direct pay or a share of profits.

#### Own-use Production Work

Work performed to produce goods or provide services mainly or exclusively for the household's or family's own final use. This activity must satisfy the "third-person criterion" (i.e., it must be possible for someone else to perform the activity on one's behalf). e.g.

a)     **Production of goods:** Growing food for household consumption (subsistence farming), fetching water, collecting firewood, constructing or maintaining one's own dwelling, manufacturing goods for household use (e.g., clothes, furniture) and

b)    **Provision of services:** Childcare, care for dependent adults, cooking, cleaning, and other domestic tasks within one's own household.

#### Unpaid Trainee Work

Work performed for others without pay, primarily to acquire workplace experience or skills. e.g. Unpaid internships, apprenticeships (where no pay or significant remuneration is received beyond perhaps a small stipend for expenses), or traineeships.

#### Volunteer Work

Non-compulsory work performed for others without pay, driven by a desire to help others, contribute to communities, the environment, or support organizations. e.g. Volunteering for a charity, community service, helping a neighbour without payment, environmental clean-up efforts.

#### Other Work Activities

A residual category for work activities that do not fit into the other four forms. This can include unpaid compulsory work (e.g., community service as a legal requirement, work for traditional communal obligations). e.g. prison labour (if unpaid)

#### Working Age Population

All persons aged 15 years and older. This is the *potential* pool of labour. It includes individuals who are employed, unemployed, or outside the labour force (e.g., students, homemakers, retirees).

#### Employed Persons

All individuals of working age who, during a short reference period (typically one week), either worked for pay or profit for at least one hour, or were temporarily absent from a job in which they had already worked, due to reasons like *sick leave, vacation, or maternity/paternity leave.*

#### Unemployed Persons

All working-age persons who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity. **Note:** individuals engaged in unpaid or own-use production work (like subsistence farming) are not considered unemployed, even if they want paid work. Instead, they may fall *outside the labour force* or *potential labour force* categories

#### Labour Force

This comprises all persons of working age who furnish the supply of labour for the production of goods and services during a specified time-reference period. It refers to the sum of all persons of working age who are employed and those who are unemployed.

#### Employment-to-Population Ratio

It is the proportion of a country's working-age population that is employed.

#### Labour Force Participation Rate

The labour force participation rate is the proportion of the working-age population that is in the labour force.

#### Persons Outside the Labour Force

Thisincludes working-age persons neither in employment nor in unemployment.

#### Future Starter

A person "not in employment" and "currently available" who does not "seek employment" because he or she has already made arrangements to start a job within a short subsequent period, set according to the general length of waiting time for starting a new job in the national context but generally not greater than three months.

#### Labour Underutilization

Thisrefers to mismatches between labour supply and demand, which translate into an unmet need for employment among the population. There are several measures of labour underutilization including unemployment, time-related underemployment, the potential labour force, and the LU1-LU4 rates.

#### Time-related Underemployment

This is defined as all persons in employment who wanted to work additional hours, whose working time in all jobs was less than a specified hours threshold, and who were available to work additional hours given an opportunity for more work.

#### Potential Labour Force

This is a subset of persons outside the labour force, which aims to measure the potential supply of labour, or in other words, it quantifies all persons with an unmet need for income-generating work and provides a measure of their degree of labour market integration. It includes persons who are either looking for a job but not currently available to work, or who are available to work but are not actively looking for a job.

#### Extended Labour Force

This is defined as the sum of the potential labour force and the labour force. It includes persons of working age who, during the short reference period, were neither in employment nor in unemployment and: (a) carried out activities to “seek employment”, were not “currently available” but would become available within a short subsequent period (i.e. unavailable jobseekers); or (b) did not carry out activities to “seek employment”, but wanted employment and were “currently available” (i.e. available potential jobseekers).

#### Unemployment

This includes all working-age persons who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity.

#### Unemployment Rate (LU1)

This is the share of the labour force that is unemployed.

#### Combined rate of time-related underemployment and unemployment (LU2)

This represents the share of the labour force that is either in unemployment or time-related underemployment.

#### Combined rate of unemployment and potential labour force (LU3)

This represents the share of the extended labour force that is in unemployment or the potential labour force.

#### Composite measure of labour underutilization (LU4)

This represents the share of the extended labour force that is in unemployment, time-related underemployment, or the potential labour force.

#### Long Term Unemployment

This is a situation of the unemployed population where the duration of employment search is 12 months or more, including the reference period.

#### Seasonal Unemployment

Unemployment varies predictably with the season. Cyclical unemployment is associated with a reduction in real output and occurs during a recession.

#### Formal Sector Enterprises

Formal sector enterprises are economic units that are **formally constituted, recognized, and regulated by government authorities**. They operate within the scope of national legal and regulatory frameworks, including those related to taxation, business registration, labour laws, and social security. Their primary objective is typically the production of goods and services for the market to generate income or profit, or for non-profit purposes, or non-market production for government/public use.

#### Informal Sector Enterprises

Informal sector enterprises are **unincorporated household enterprises** that are **not formally constituted, recognized, or regulated by government authorities**, or are not sufficiently covered by formal arrangements in law or in practice. Their production of goods and services is primarily intended for the market with the purpose of generating income and profit, but they operate outside or insufficiently within formal legal and regulatory frameworks.

#### Household Sector

This refers to households acting as employers for individuals performing domestic services (e.g., housekeepers, nannies, gardeners) for remuneration. The *employment relationship* for these domestic workers can be either formal or informal. The "household" in this context is the **employer unit**, not an "enterprise" in the typical business sense, nor is the *work itself* usually considered "own-use production" as it's for remuneration.

### Types of Work & Employment Relationships

#### Full-time Work

Typically involves working a standard number of hours per week (e.g., 35-40 hours), with a regular schedule and consistent pay. Often comes with benefits like health insurance, paid leave, and retirement plans.

#### Part-time Work

This involves working fewer hours than full-time employees, often with flexible schedules. Pay is usually on a pro-rata basis, and benefits may or may not be included.

#### Casual Work/Employment

Highly flexible, "as-needed" basis, without guaranteed hours or long-term commitment. Payment is often daily or per task, and typically without standard benefits. It does not provideengagements for a period longer than 90 days. They have no formal employment contract with the employer and their services may be terminated with or without notice.

#### Temporary Employment

Work for a limited period, often project-based, seasonal, or to cover absences. May be direct hires or through staffing agencies.

#### Contract Employment (Fixed-Term)

Hired for a specific project, task, or defined timeframe, with a start and end date specified in the contract. Often treated as self-employed for tax purposes.

#### Apprenticeship

A structured training program that combines on-the-job learning with formal education or classroom instruction, typically for skilled trades. Apprentices earn a salary while learning.

#### Gig Work / On-Demand Work

Short-term, task-based jobs are often facilitated through digital platforms (e.g., ride-sharing, food delivery, online freelance tasks). Characterized by flexibility but often lacks traditional employee benefits and job security.

#### Formal Employment

Formal employment refers to work arrangements that are recognized, regulated, and protected by existing legal and regulatory frameworks. Workers in formal employment typically have explicit (written or oral) contracts, defined working conditions, and access to social protection and benefits. Primarily occurs within **formal sector enterprises** (businesses and organizations that are registered with tax authorities, operate under legal frameworks, and adhere to regulations).

#### Informal Employment

Informal employment refers to all remunerative work (both self-employment and wage employment) that is **not registered, regulated, or protected by existing legal or regulatory frameworks**, and therefore lacks access to social protection and employment benefits. It also includes non-remunerative work undertaken in an income-producing enterprise (e.g., contributing family workers who do not receive formal pay).

#### Own-account workers in household market enterprises without employees

Individuals who operate unincorporated household market enterprises without employing any employees on a continuous basis. This is the traditional "self-employed" category.

#### Dependent Workers

These workers typically provide labour for another economic unit or person, with less control over their work organization or exposure to economic risk compared to independent workers.

#### Dependent contractors

This is a new and significant category. It refers to workers who provide labour to others under contractual arrangements that are similar to self-employment, but they are dependent on a single or a limited number of economic units for the organization of their work, income, or access to the market. They often do not employ others and are sometimes referred to as "dependent self-employed" or "false self-employed."

## Income and consumption

Households have personal needs and wants that are directly satisfied through consumption of goods and services resulting from activities that are productive in an economic sense. These goods and services are referred to as consumer goods and services and their individual value is defined as the consumption expenditure on these goods or services. 

### Household income

Household income is the sum of money income and income in kind and consists of receipts which, as a rule, are of a recurring nature and accrue to the household or to individual members of the household regularly at annual or at more frequent intervals (ILO,2000). Household income consists of receipts in cash, in kind or in services, that are usually recurrent and regular and are received by the household or by individual members of the household at annual or at more frequent intervals. During the reference period when they are received, such receipts are potentially available for current consumption and, as a rule, do not reduce the net worth of the household (ILO,2001). Income is thus defined in terms of a broad grouping of sources of income as follows:

### Income from employment

Income from employment comprises receipts from involvement in economic activities, strictly in an employment-related capacity. It consists of employee income (e.g. wages) and self-employment income (return to labour), (ILO, 2000).

### Employee income

Employee income consists of direct wages and salaries, cash bonuses and gratuities, commissions, directors’ fees, profit-sharing bonuses and other forms of profit-related pay, remuneration for time not worked (e.g. as sick leave or annual leave), free or subsidized goods and services from an employer as well as severance and termination pay. Employee income can be in cash (in the sense of monetary), in kind as goods or services.

### Income from self employment

Income from self-employment is defined as the income which is received, over a given reference period, by individuals, for themselves or in respect of their family members, as a result of their current or former involvement in self-employment jobs” (ILO 2000). Income from self employment is taken as income received as a result of involvement in a self-employment job. It should be noted that this component is restricted to owners of unincorporated enterprises who work in such enterprises.

### Property Income

Property incomeis income received from ownership of financial and other assets, e.g. interest payments. Property income consists of receipts received as a result of ownership of financial and non-financial assets that are provided to others for their use. These are usually in the form of interest receipts, dividends, rents received for the use of unproduced assets (natural resources), royalties for use of intellectual property and rents received for produced assets.

### Income from household production of services for own consumption

This is income from household production of services for own consumption, e.g. services of owner-occupied housing, household production of domestic services for own consumption. These are services produced within the household for the household’s own consumption and not for the market. They include services from owner-occupied dwellings and from consumer durable goods owned as well as own-produced domestic services. They are valued net of expenses that go into their production

### Transfers

Transfers are receipts for which there is no “quid pro quo”, i.e. nothing tangible is given by the recipient to the donor in return for the receipts. Transfers may be made between households, between households and government or between households and charities. Transfers are mainly  motivated by the intention to redistribute income. Transfers can consist of cash (monetary) or goods or of services and can cross national boundaries. Capital transfers are one-off or irregular and are usually large, lump-sum receipts. In contrast, current transfers usually recur regularly and tend to be small. Current transfers are also mostly available for use in consumption expenditure during the reference period while recipients of capital transfers do not usually regard them as income and do not use them wholly for consumption expenditure during the reference period.

### Current Transfers (in cash and goods)

Current transfers whether in cash or goods consist of social security pensions/schemes; pensions and other insurance benefits; current transfers from non-profit institutions and current transfers from other households.

### Current Transfers (Services)

These aresocial transfers in kind from government-provided services to individual households such as education, health, social welfare, transport and cultural services.

### Holding gains

Holding gains are changes in the value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities over a reference period which occur without any direct action of the owner, for example, changes in the value of stocks and shares. A holding gain, the result of an increase in assets or a reduction in liability, increases the net worth of the owner’s assets while a loss has the opposite effect.

### Household Consumption Expenditure

This is the value of consumer goods and services that were acquired (used or paid for) by a household for the direct satisfaction of the needs and wants of its members through direct monetary purchases in the market; through the market-place but without using any money as means of payment (barter, income in kind); or from production within the household (own-account production).

### Consumption expenditure on non-durable goods and services

This is expenditure incurred on goods including food items, personal care items, fuel, educational and entertainment items,  household items such as cleaning products and so on.

### Consumption expenditure on durable goods

This is expenditure on household kitchen appliances, household information and entertainment appliances, other household appliances, household transportation equipment, other household items, clothing items, utensils, and so on. Consumer goods that are used many times over a long period of time without reducing their capacity to satisfy needs and wants are referred to as durable goods.

### Intertemporal consumption

Intertemporal consumption refers to how individuals allocate their consumption of goods and services across different time periods, typically balancing consumption today versus in the future. The decision is influenced by factors such as income, interest rates, time preferences, and expectations about the future.

**Net Disposable Income**

This is a social health insurance system in Kenya that is operated through individuals contributing funds to a common pool through regular premiums, deducted from salaries or paid directly, to finance care services for themselves and their dependents. The Social Health Insurance Fund is governed by the Social Health Insurance Act (SHIA) of 2023 and it introduces three funds: Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF), Primary Healthcare Fund and Emergency, Chronic, and Critical Illness Fund.

### Social Health Insurance Fund

This is a fund aimed at promoting the implementation of universal health coverage by ensuring all individuals and communities receive the health services they need, including the full spectrum of essential, quality health services from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care without suffering financial hardship. The fund has been established by the government to improve the quality of life for all citizens by providing equitable, accessible, affordable, and high-standard healthcare.

### Social Insurance

These are contributory programmes where participants make regular payments to a scheme that will cover costs related to life-course events, for example, maternity, unemployment or illness. Social insurance includes contributory pensions; health, unemployment, or disaster insurance; and funeral assistance. Social insurance is strongly linked to the formal labour market, meaning coverage is often limited to formal workers.

### Social pensions

These are state pensions, a form of cash transfer targeted by age. Pensions are the most common social protection tool, with the widest global coverage and often highest national spend. The current pensions schemes in Kenya comprise the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) which is a state contributory scheme mandatory for all employers and employees in the formal sector and informal sector workers who can contribute on voluntary basis, Civil Servants Pension Scheme which is non-contributory and administered by The National Treasury for the government for retired civil servants and (iii) private pension schemes.

### Social risks

Defined as events or circumstances that may adversely affect the welfare of households either by imposing additional demands on their resources or by reducing their income. Needs may occur due to sickness, unemployment, retirement, housing, education, or family circumstances.

### Social Security

Social security is defined as the security that the society furnishes through appropriate organizations against certain risks to which its members are exposed. The concept of social security is based on ideas of human dignity and social justice. The underlying idea behind social security measures is that a citizen who has contributed or is likely to con­tribute to his/her country’s welfare should be given protection against certain hazards. The concept of social security, thus, is based on the ideals of human dignity and socio-economic justice. Underlying the concept is also the desire to give protection to its citizens to contribute to a coun­try’s total welfare against certain hazards of life to which they are exposed either in the working life or as a consequence of it.

### The Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC)

This is a poverty-targeted and household-based programme with the objective of providing regular cash transfers to poor families living with children identified as OVCs to encourage fostering and retention of children and promote their human capital development.

The spring is typically protected from runoff, bird droppings and animals by a "spring box", which is constructed of brick, masonry, or concrete and is built around the spring so that water flows directly out of the box into a pipe or cistern, without being exposed to outside pollution.

#### Tanker-truck

The water is trucked into a community and sold from the water truck.

### Rent

The charge for use of land, buildings or other real property, payable by a tenant to a landlord at regular intervals, usually monthly.

#### Residential building

A building for which the major part (more than 50% of its gross floor area) is built for dwelling purposes, i.e. for habitation of households.

#### Room

A space in a housing unit or other living quarters enclosed by walls reaching from the floor to the ceiling or roof covering, or at least to a height of 2 metres, of a size large enough to hold a bed for an adult, that is at least 4 square metres. Passage ways, verandahs, lobbies, bath-rooms, and toilet rooms are not expected to be counted as rooms, even if they meet the criteria.

#### Source of water

The point at which a household accesses water for domestic use.

#### Tenant or Renter

An occupant of land or building in subordination to owner’s title and with the owner’s assent, who holds real estate under lease, who pays rent in return for the right to occupy land or building, who holds or possesses land or building by title.

#### Tenure

The proprietary status indicates whether households are owners or tenants in their dwellings.

#### Toilet

 An installation for the disposal of human excreta.

#### Wall

A vertical load-bearing or non-load-bearing member of a structure whose length exceeds four times its thickness.

#### Human waste disposal

Refers to the handling of human excreta including faeces and urine.

#### Informal settlements

Refers to urban settlements characterized by poor structural quality of housing; lack of formal basic services and infrastructure; and lack of security of tenure. In most cases, they are located in geographically and environmentally hazardous areas.

Refers to a large and isolated part of an open or agricultural country with relatively low population concentrations and whose predominant economic activity is agricultural.

#### Slum

A predominantly residential area characterized by high population densities, deteriorated buildings, littered streets, unsanitary and hazardous conditions and economic distress.

#### Urban area

Refers to any aggregate part of the county, region or country made up of urban centres or parts of urban centres.

#### Urban Centre

This is characterised by a concentration of economic activity and infrastructure, in addition to having a vastly higher population density than its surrounding areas. It might be seen as a built-up and compact human settlement with a population of at least 2,000 people. An urban centre may be classified as a market centre, town, municipality or city. Urban centres are also service centres that provide goods and services to both the resident and surrounding population. As such, an urban centre may constitute some trading centres with less than 2,000 people.

#### Urbanization

This is the process of concentration of a country’s national population into settlements designated as urban centres. It’s the process whereby a society is transformed from an essentially rural to a predominantly urban one.

## Culture

### Culture

Culture is a set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features of society or a social group that encompasses not only art and literature, but lifestyles, ways of living together, value systems, traditions and beliefs (UNESCO, 2001). Whereas it is not always possible to measure such beliefs and values directly, it is possible to measure associated behaviours and practices.

Culture plays a key role in all societies around the world, influencing various facets of peoples’ lives, from leisure to professional activities.

### Conservation

Are measures undertaken to extend the life of cultural heritage while strengthening transmission of its significant heritage messages and values (ICCROM, 1998). In the domain of cultural property, the aim of conservation is to maintain the physical and cultural characteristics of the object to ensure that its value is not diminished and that it will outlive our limited time span (UNESCO, 1988).

### Copyright

This is one of the main branches of intellectual property. It applies to “every production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression. The expression “literary and artistic works” is to be understood, for the purposes of copyright protection, as including every original work of authorship, irrespective of its literary or artistic merit. Literary and artistic works include books, pamphlets and other writings, music, plays, choreography, photography, films, paintings, drawings, architecture, engraving, lithography (WIPO, 2003, 1979).

### Craft or artisanal products

These are defined as “those produced by artisans, either completely by hand or with the help of hand-tools or even mechanical means, as long as the direct manual contribution of the artisan remains the most substantial component of the finished product. The special nature of artisanal products derives from their distinctive features, which can be utilitarian, aesthetic, artistic, creative, culturally attached, decorative, functional, traditional, religiously and socially symbolic and significant” (UNESCO and ITC, 1997).

### Cultural activities

They embody or convey cultural expressions, irrespective of the commercial value they may have. Cultural activities may be an end in themselves or they may contribute to the production of cultural goods and services.

### Cultural diversity

Refers to the many ways in which the different cultures of groups and societies find expression. These cultural expressions are passed on within and among groups and societies, and from generation to generation. Cultural diversity, however, is evident not only in the varied ways in which cultural heritage is expressed, augmented and transmitted but also in the different modes of artistic creation, production, dissemination, distribution and enjoyment, whatever the means and technologies that are used.

### Cultural goods

Defined as consumer goods that convey ideas, symbols and ways of life, i.e. books, magazines, multimedia products software, recordings, films, videos, audio-visual programmes, crafts and fashion.

### Cultural heritage

This includes artefacts, monuments, a group of buildings and sites that have a diversity of values including symbolic, historic, artistic, aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological, scientific and social significance (UNESCO, 1972). Cultural industries produce and distribute cultural goods or services as defined above.

### Cultural landscape

Represents combined works of nature and humans, and they express a long and intimate relationship between people and their natural environment (UNESCO, 2007).

### Cultural participation

This is participation in the arts and everyday life activities that may be associated with a particular culture. It refers to “the ways in which ethnically-marked differences in cultural tastes, values and behaviours inform not just artistic and media preferences but are embedded in the daily rhythms of different ways of life; and of the ways in which these connect with other relevant social characteristics – those of class and gender, for example” (Bennett, 2001).

### Cultural services

This is participation in the arts and everyday life activities that may be associated with a particular culture. It refers to “the ways in which ethnically-marked differences in cultural tastes, values and behaviours inform not just artistic and media preferences but are embedded in the daily rhythms of different ways of life; and of the ways in which these connect with other relevant social characteristics – those of class and gender, for example” (Bennett, 2001).

### Design

Consists of units mainly engaged in the creative, artistic and aesthetic design of objects, environments and services (ABS, 2001).

### Fashion design

The process of conceptualizing and creating clothing, footwear, and fashion accessories that reflect aesthetic, cultural, or functional values. It is recognized as part of the creative industries and may involve both artisanal and industrial methods. Fashion design is protected under intellectual property frameworks such as industrial design and copyright

### Graphic design

Carried out by companies or individuals engaged primarily in the design of graphic material for the purposes of display or publication.

### Indigenous

Peoples are persons in independent countries who are regarded as “indigenous” on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions" (ILO, 1989).

### Intangible cultural heritage (ICH)

Defined as “the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognise as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity” (UNESCO, 2003).

### Interactive media

Defined as media where either i) two or more objects have an effect on one another; ii) the user can effect a change on an object or within the environment (users playing videos games); iii) they involve active participation of a user; or iv) there is two way effect as opposed to one way or simple cause effect (Canadian Heritage, 2008).

### Interior design

Activities carried out by companies and individuals engaged primarily in the design of interior environments of buildings, private and public, residential and commercial (Statistics New Zealand, 1995).

### Landscape design

Covers the design of lands and gardens for human use. Usually, this relates to the design of and adjacent to buildings, either private or public, but the design can also relate to large public areas such as parks and reserves (Statistics New Zealand, 1995).

### Library

This is an organisation, or part of an organisation, whose main aims are to build and maintain a collection and to facilitate the use of such information resources and facilities as are required to meet the informational, research, educational, cultural or recreational needs of its users; these are the basic requirements for a library and do not exclude any additional resources and services incidental to its main purpose (ISO, 2006). It includes any organized collection of books and periodicals in electronic or in printed form or of any other graphic or audio-visual materials (adapted from UNESCO, 1970). It includes virtual libraries, digital catalogues.

### Museum

A non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment.

a\. The above definition of a museum shall be applied without any limitation arising from the nature of the governing body, the territorial character, the functional structure or the orientation of the collections of the institution concerned.

b\. In addition to institutions designated as 'museums' the following qualify as museums for the purposes of this definition:

i\. natural, archaeological and ethnographic monuments and sites and historical monuments and sites of a museum nature that acquire, conserve and communicate material evidence of people and their environment;

ii\. institutions holding collections of and displaying live specimens of plants and animals, such as  botanical and zoological gardens, aquaria and vivaria;

and management of tangible or intangible heritage resources (living heritage and digital creative activity); and

ix\. such other institutions as the Executive Council, after seeking the advice of the Advisory Committee, considers as having some or all the characteristics of a museum, or as supporting museums and professional museum personnel through museological research, education or training (ICOM 2007).

### Natural heritage

This consists of natural features, geological and physiographical formations and delineated areas that constitute the habitat of threatened species of animals and plants and natural sites of value from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty. It includes nature parks and reserves, zoos, aquaria and botanical gardens (UNESCO, 1972).

### Performing Arts and Celebration

Refers to professional or amateur performing arts activities, such as theatre, dance, opera and puppetry, as well as the celebration of cultural events (festivals, feasts and fairs), which occur locally and can be informal in nature.

### Preservation

The aim of preservation is to prevent damage liable to be caused by environmental or accidental factors, which pose a threat in the immediate surroundings of the object to be conserved. Accordingly, preventive methods and measures are not usually applied directly but are designed to control the microclimatic conditions of the environment with the aim of eradicating harmful agents or elements, which may have a temporary or permanent influence on the deterioration of the object (UNESCO, 1988).

### Recreation

Defined as an activity undertaken for pleasure or relaxation that diverts amuses or stimulates.

### Sports and Physical recreation

Consists of companies and individuals mainly engaged in the presentation or provision of sports and physical recreation and associated services. Coaching and education services related to sports and physical recreation are included. Also included are business units, which manufacture wholesale or retail sports and physical recreation goods.

### Traditional knowledge

Refers to the knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities around the world. Developed from experience gained over the centuries and adapted to the local culture and environment, traditional knowledge is transmitted orally from generation to generation. It tends to be collectively owned and takes the form of stories, songs, folklore, proverbs, cultural values, beliefs, rituals, community laws, local language and agricultural practices, including the development of plant species and animal breeds. Traditional knowledge is mainly of a practical nature, particularly in such fields as agriculture, fisheries, health, horticulture, forestry and environmental management in general” (SCBD, 2007).

### Tribal peoples

Persons in independent countries whose social, cultural and economic conditions distinguish them from other sections of the national community, and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or traditions or by special laws or regulations.

### Visual arts

Appeal primarily to the visual sense; they are art forms that focus on the creation of works, which are primarily visual in nature, or are multidimensional objects.

## Time-Use

### Average time spent

The average time spent in an activity can be computed either with reference to the whole population of the category or specifically to those who participated in the activity. Therefore, the participation rate for the activity is required, and two series of tables are presented:

1.       Average time spent per day by the population and

2.     Average time spent per day by persons who engaged in the activity.

Basic time use statistics typically provide estimates of the average time spent per day on various types of activities by individuals within specific demographic groups. These categories may include men, women, boys, and girls within certain age groups, as well as distinctions such as rural or urban residence, employment status, and more. To ensure accurate averages, time use data should encompass both weekdays and weekends, and account for seasonal variations throughout the year.

### Participation rate

The participation rate refers to the proportion of individuals in the survey population who took part in a specific activity during the reference period, such as in  the last 24 hours.

### Time slot

A one-hour interval within a 24-hour period during which respondents reported one or more activities.

### Simultaneous activities

Simultaneous activities are those undertaken by the same person at the same time and place. For instance: cooking while listening to the radio, or cleaning the house while caring for the children etc.

### System of National Accounts (SNA) Productive

Activities within the SNA production boundary include the production of goods and services supplied or intended to be supplied to others, own-account production of goods retained by producers, own-account production of housing services by owner-occupiers and of domestic and personal services produced in a household by paid domestic staff.

The SNA excludes unpaid household activities that produce domestic or personal services for consumption within the same household, except when performed by paid staff.

### Non-SNA productive (extended SNA)

Non-SNA include unpaid domestic and personal services produced and consumed within the same household, such as cleaning, maintenance, and repairs, meal preparation and serving, care and instruction of children, care for the sick, elderly, or infirm, transportation of household members or their goods and unpaid volunteer services to other households, communities, or associations

### Non-productive activities

An activity is considered non-productive if it cannot be delegated to someone else, according to the "third-person rule." These include personal maintenance activities such as eating, sleeping, exercising and leisure or recreational activities such as watching TV, playing games and hobbies.

### Productive work

Productive work refers to activities that can be delegated to another person and still produce the same result. All such activities fall within the general production boundary.

### Reproductive work

Reproductive work includes activities such as rearing and caring for children; caring for the elderly, ill, disabled and other household members; caring unpaid for non-family members; and cooking, cleaning and fetching water and fuel. Though these activities are productive, they are not included in GDP calculations.

### Care of children and adults

This refers to time spent caring for or helping any child (under 18) or adult in the household, regardless of their health status. Care is categorized into:

### Primary childcare

Time spent directly and exclusively on a child while not engaged in any other activity, such as feeding, bathing, playing, or helping with homework.

### Primary adult care

Time spent directly helping or caring for an adult, such as bathing, grooming, or assisting with household tasks like cleaning or cooking.

### Secondary care of children and adults

Care provided while engaged in another primary activity. For example, watching over a child doing homework while cooking dinner or watching over a sick parent while doing house chores

### Time-use surveys

Statistical survey that aims to report data on how people spend their time. If the necessary R&D coefficients cannot be derived from other surveys or administrative data, time-use surveys are the recommended method to derive the necessary informationfor estimating the R&D component of full-time equivalents (FTEs) and expenditures.

### Passive Care

Monitoring or supervising another person without direct interaction. For example, watching children get dressed or supervising a family member taking medication. This may occur while performing other tasks or as a primary activity.

### Active Care

Active care involves direct interaction with the person being cared for. Examples include helping someone dress or administering medication.

### Household Production Satellite Account

A statistical framework that estimates the value of unpaid work in the household, such as childcare, adult care, housework, and volunteering. Specifically, the household production satellite accounts show the relation between the monetary value of unpaid work to the total GDP providing relevant information that complements the GDP.

### Simultaneous or parallel activities

These involve performing two or more activities during the same time interval. The primary activity is the one whose value added exceeds that of other activities and it's deemed most important or requiring the most concentration. The secondary activity is carried out at the same time as the primary activity but considered of lesser importance

### Time-use diaries

Diaries that capture all activities undertaken by a respondent over a defined reference period (e.g. a full 24-hour period, a weekday and a weekend day, a full week, etc.). They capture start and end times, activity duration, sequence, and frequency.

### Activity classification system

A structured system that categorizes activities into groups to analyze how people spend their time. It supports policymaking and statistical reporting through a hierarchical structure that assigns numeric codes to each activity.

### International Classification of Activities for Time-Use Statistics (ICATUS):

A standard classification of all activities that the general population may engage in over a 24 hours period. The classification provides categories for compiling internationally comparable time-use statistic

Paid work

Unpaid work

### Productive activity

an activity is considered productive if it can be delegated to someone else or if it yields an output that is capable of being exchanged.

### Unproductive activity/Personal care activity

Activities performed for personal maintenance and care such as eating, drinking, sleeping, exercising etc. are non-productive or personal activities: these cannot be delegated to a person other than the one benefiting from them. Similarly, activities associated with socializing, entertainment, participation in sports, hobbies and games, and use of mass media are considered non-productive activities.
