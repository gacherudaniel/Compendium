# Economic Statistics

## Macroeconomic accounts and statistics

### System of National Accounts

#### System of National Accounts (SNA)

The internationally agreed standard set of recommendations on how to compile measures of economic activity. It is a comprehensive, consistent and flexible set of macroeconomic accounts to meet the needs of government and private-sector analysts, policymakers, and decision-takers.

#### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

The total value of goods and services produced by resident producer units of a country for a specified period of time, usually one year. It is the sum of gross value added of all resident producer units (institutional sectors or industries).

#### GDP at Market Prices

The sum total of the gross values added of all resident producers at producers’ prices, less subsidies on imports, plus all non-deductible Value Added Taxes (VAT) (or similar taxes).

#### GDP at current Prices

The total value of goods and services valued at prices of the particular year of reporting. This is also referred to as nominal GDP.

#### Base Year

The year used as the base period for compilation of constant price estimates. The base year is reflected to be normal i.e. a year without major  shocks or structural changes. The base year of the national accounts is chosen to allow for year-to-year comparisons.

#### GDP at Constant Prices

The total value of goods and services for a particular period based on prices of a pre-determined base year.

#### GDP per Capita

The average production per person of goods and services for a specified period e.g. one year. It is used to compare the relative welfare or standard of living in different countries in a particular period.

#### Gross Output

Output that consists of goods or services that are produced within an establishment that become available for use outside that establishment, plus any goods and services produced for own final use.

#### Intermediate Consumption

Consists of the value of the goods and services consumed as inputs by a process of production, excluding fixed assets whose consumption is recorded as consumption of fixed capital; the goods or services may be either transformed or used up by the production process.

#### Gross Value Added (GVA)

GVA is derived as the gross output less the intermediate consumption.

#### Compensation of Employees

This is the total remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees and comprises wages and salaries and the value of social contributions paid by employers.

#### Operating Surplus

The operating surplus measures the surplus or deficit accruing from production before taking account of any interest, rent or similar charges payable on financial or tangible non-produced assets borrowed or rented by the enterprise, or any interest, rent or similar receipts receivable on financial or tangible non-produced assets owned by the enterprise; (note: for unincorporated enterprises owned by households, this component is called "mixed income").

#### Mixed Income

The surplus or deficit accruing from production by unincorporated enterprises owned by households; it implicitly contains an element of remuneration for work done by the owner, or other members of the household, that cannot be separately identified from the return to the owner as entrepreneur, but it excludes the operating surplus coming from owner-occupied dwellings.

#### Other Taxes on Production

Taxes other than those incurred directly as a result of engaging in production; they mainly consist of current taxes on the labour or capital employed in the enterprise, such as payroll taxes or current taxes on vehicles or buildings.

#### Basic Prices

The amount receivable by the producer from the purchaser for a unit of a good or service produced as output minus any tax payable, and plus any subsidy receivable, on that unit as a consequence of its production or sale; it excludes any transport charges invoiced separately by the producer.

#### Purchasers’ Prices

The amount paid by the purchaser, excluding any deductible VAT or similar deductible tax, in order to take delivery of a unit of a good or service at the time and place required by the purchaser; the purchaser's price of a good includes any transport charges paid separately by the purchaser to take delivery at the required time and place.

#### Government Final Consumption Expenditure

Expenditure, including imputed expenditure, incurred by the general government on both individual consumption goods and services and collective consumption services.

#### General Government

The sector consists of the totality of institutional units which, in addition to fulfilling their political responsibilities and their role of economic regulation, produce principally non-market services (possibly goods) for individual or collective consumption and redistribute income and wealth.

#### Household/Private Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE)

Expenditure incurred by the resident households on final consumption of goods and services, whether made within or outside the economic territory.

#### Final consumption expenditure by NPISH

The Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) is defined as the expenditure incurred by the resident non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) on final consumption of goods and services, whether made within or outside the economic territory.

#### Gross Fixed Capital Formation

This is measured as the total value of a producer's acquisitions, less disposals, of fixed assets during the accounting period plus certain additions to the value of non-produced assets realised by the productive activity of institutional units. Expenditure on mineral exploration and military ware not used purely for war purposes are included in GFCF. However, intangible assets, such as copyrights, computer software etc, are not included due to unavailability of reliable data.

#### Fixed Assets

Tangible or intangible assets produced as outputs from processes of production that are themselves used repeatedly or continuously in other processes of production for more than one year.

#### Consumption of Fixed Capital

Constitutes the decline in the value of the fixed assets owned by an enterprise, as a result of their physical deterioration and normal rates of obsolescence and accidental damage. In other words it is the wear and tear of an asset during the accounting period.

#### Changes in Inventories

Changes in inventories (including work-in-progress) consist of changes in :(a) stocks of outputs that are still held by the units that produced them prior to their being further processed, sold, delivered to other units or used in other ways; and(b) stocks of products acquired from other units that are intended to be used for intermediate consumption or for resale without further processing; they are measured by the value of the entries into inventories less the value of withdrawals and the value of any recurrent losses of goods held in inventories.

#### GDP by Production Approach

The production approach, which is also called the output approach, measures GDP as the difference between value of output less the value of goods and services used in producing these outputs during an accounting period

#### GDP by Expenditure Approach

GDP by expenditure approach also known as the aggregate demand is defined as private final consumption expenditure + government final consumption expenditure + gross capital formation + exports - imports.

#### GDP by Income approach

The income approach estimates GDP as the sum of the incomes receivable by each institutional sector from the domestic production of goods and services.

#### Gross National Income (GNI)

The aggregate value of the gross balances of primary incomes for all sectors. GNI is the gross domestic product, plus net receipts from abroad of compensation of employees, property income and net taxes less subsidies on production.

#### Gross National Disposable Income

Gross national disposable income may be derived from gross national income by adding all current transfers in cash or in kind receivable by resident institutional units from non-resident units and subtracting all current transfers in cash or in kind payable by resident institutional units to non-resident units.

#### Saving

Net saving is net disposable income less final consumption expenditure.

#### Net Lending/Borrowing

Net amount a unit or a sector has available to finance, directly or indirectly, other units or other sectors; it is the balancing item in the capital account and is defined as: (Net saving plus capital transfers receivable minus capital transfers payable) minus (the value of acquisitions less disposals of non-financial assets, less consumption of fixed capital); negative net lending may also be described as "net borrowing".

#### GDP Statistical Discrepancy

This is the difference between GDP compiled by the various approaches, e.g. the difference between GDP by production approach and GDP by expenditure approach.

#### Supply and use Tables

The Supply Table describes how goods and services become available in an economy during a certain period of time. Products are either produced in the domestic industry or imported.  The Use Table shows how goods and services are used in the economy during a certain period of time.

#### Input-Output Tables

An input-output table is a means of presenting a detailed analysis of the process of production and the use of goods and services (products) and the income generated in that production.; they can be either in the form of (a) supply and use tables or (b) symmetric input-output tables.

#### Social Accounting Matrices (SAM)

A means of presenting the SNA accounts in a matrix which elaborates the linkages between a supply and use table and institutional sector accounts; a typical focus of a SAM on the role of people in the economy may be reflected by, among other things, extra breakdowns of the household sector and a disaggregated representation of labour markets (i.e., distinguishing various categories of employed persons).

#### Satellite Accounts

Satellite accounts provide a framework linked to the central accounts and which enables attention to be focussed on a certain field or aspect of economic and social life in the context of national accounts; common examples are satellite accounts for the environment, or tourism, or unpaid household work.

### Balance of payments and international investment position

#### Balance of Payments

A systematic statistical statement that summarizes for a given period (e.g. calendar year), an economy’s transactions with the rest of the world. BOP captures transactions between residents and nonresidents, irrespective of the currency in which the transaction is made. BOP comprises the Current Account (Goods and Services; Primary Income; and Secondary Income) and the Capital and Financial Accounts.

#### Current Account

The current account focuses on transactions related to the exchange of goods, services, income, and current transfers. It consists of Goods, Services, Primary Income and Secondary Income sub-accounts.

#### Goods Account

Includes the export and import of physical goods (merchandise). It also includes trade in goods by a resident and subsequent resale of these goods without them being physically present in the country. This concept is referred to as merchanting.

#### Services Account

It covers the export and import of services. These are categorized into twelve broad categories in the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6) as follows; Manufacturing of Physical Inputs owned by Others; Maintenance and Repair Services; Transport; Travel; Construction; Insurance and Pension Services; Financial Services; Charges for the use of  intellectual property n.i.e; Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services; Other Business Services (including Trade, Technical and related services,Research and development services, professional and management consulting services, waste treatment and depollution, agricultural and mining services, operating leasing, Trade related services ; Personal, cultural and recreation services; and Government  goods and services n.i.e

#### Primary Income Account

Primary income captures returns for the provision of labor and financial assets; and renting of natural resources between resident and non-resident entities. This account records compensation of employees, income from investments such as dividends, interest, reinvested earnings; investment income attributable to policyholders in insurance, standardized guarantees, and pension funds; and rent.

#### Secondary Income Account

This account records transfers of money or value between residents and non-residents, where no goods or services are exchanged. This includes:

·       Personal transfers: All current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from nonresident households. They include remittances sent by workers to their families in their home countries.

·       Other current transfers: These include Social contributions, social benefits,net premiums and claims on non-life insurance, Contributions from foreign governments, charitable donations, and other financial transfers, including aid and gifts.

#### Current Account Balance

The current account balance is the sum of the balances of the four sub-accounts:

Current Account Balance (CAB) = Balance of the Goods Account + Services Account Balance + Balance in the Primary Income Account + Balance in the Secondary Income Account

#### Current Account Surplus/Deficit

A current account surplus occurs when a country earns more income from abroad than it spends i.e. the CAB is a positive value. On the other hand, a current account deficit results from greater expenditure on goods produced or services rendered by non-residents as well as increased payments on factors of production, including interest and labour.

#### Capital Account

This account shows (a) capital transfers receivable and payable between residents and nonresidents and (b) the acquisition and disposal of non-produced, nonfinancial assets between residents and nonresidents.

Capital transfers are transfers in which the ownership of an asset (other than cash or inventories) changes from one party to another; or which obliges one or both parties to acquire or dispose of an asset (other than cash or inventories); or where a liability is forgiven by the creditor. This include debt forgiveness, investment grants, one-off guarantees and debt assumption, large gifts and inheritances (legacies), including those to nonprofit  institutions; cash grants from donor governments or multilateral financial institutions to the debtor economy to be used to repay debt

Non-produced, non-financial assets consist of natural resources, contracts, leases and licenses; and marketing assets (including goodwill).

#### Financial Account

This account records transactions that involve financial assets and liabilities that take place between residents and nonresidents. It tracks cross-border investments and transactions that change the ownership of financial assets and liabilities. The financial account indicates the functional categories, sectors, instruments and maturities used for net international financing transactions. Entries in the financial account can be corresponding entries to goods, services, income, capital account, or other financial account entries. The financial account shows net acquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities. There are five functional categories in the Financial Account which include Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, Other Investment, Financial Derivatives  and Reserve Assets.

#### Direct Investment

This arises when an entity, resident in one economy has equity shareholding or equivalent voting rights of 10% per cent or more in an entity resident in another economy that gives rise to a significant degree of influence or control in the management of this non-resident entity. A significant degree of influence exists when the non-resident Direct Investor has shareholding or equivalent voting rights of between 10 to 50 per cent of the value resident entity while control exists when the shareholding is more than 50 per cent.

Enterprises in a direct investment relationship with each other are called affiliates or affiliated enterprises. In addition, all enterprises that are under the control or influence of the same direct investor are considered to be in a direct investment relationship with each other.

#### Portfolio Investment

This is defined as cross border transactions and positions involving debt or equity securities, other than those included in direct investment or reserve assets. Investments by a non-resident in an economy in form of shares/voting rights of less than 10% (equity securities) and/or investment in financial instruments which are tradable (debt/non-equity securities). The negotiability of securities is a way of facilitating trading, allowing them to be held by different parties during their lives.

Portfolio investment covers, but is not limited to, securities traded on organized or other financial markets and usually involves financial infrastructure, such as a suitable legal, regulatory, and settlement framework, along with market-making dealers, and a sufficient volume of buyers and sellers. Transactions in listed equity in the Securities markets or organized exchanges constitute Portfolio Investment.

#### Other Investment

This captures any other investment by a non-resident in an economy that cannot be classified either as Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, financial derivatives and employee stock options; and reserve assets. This comprises other equity (less than 10% of voting rights and non-tradable); currency and deposits; loans (including the use of IMF credit and loans from the IMF); trade credits and advances; insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes; accounts payable and receivable; and SDR allocations.

Other investments may be split by financial asset or liability class, original or remaining maturity, or institutional sector.

#### Reserve Assets

Reserve assets are those external assets that are readily available to and controlled by monetary authorities for meeting balance of payments financing needs, for intervention in exchange markets to affect the currency exchange rate, and for other related purposes (such as maintaining confidence in the currency and the economy; and serving as a basis for foreign borrowing). This includes central bank holdings of foreign exchange reserves, monetary gold, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) holdings, Reserve Position in the Fund and debt securities .

#### International Investment Position

International Investment Position (IIP) is a statistical statement that shows at a point in time the value and composition of financial assets of residents of an economy that are claims on nonresidents and gold bullion held as reserve assets; and liabilities of residents of an economy to non residents. The key components of IIP are similar to the components of the Financial Account of the Balance of Payments and include Direct Investment Assets/Liabilities, Portfolio Investment Assets/Liabilities, Other Investment Assets/Liabilities, Financial derivatives and Reserve Assets.

The difference between an economy’s external financial assets and liabilities is the economy’s net IIP, which may be positive or negative.

#### Financial Assets

These are financial claims by residents of a country on non-residents/rest of the world. The existence of the counterpart liability distinguishes financial assets from other economic assets, such as land, dwellings, machinery, equipment, etc.

#### Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are financial claims on residents by non-residents/rest of the world.

#### Rest of the world

Consists of all non-resident institutional units that enter into transactions with resident units, or have other economic links with resident units.

#### Residency

A resident is an individual, entity or organization located in an economic territory, with which it has the centre of predominant economic interest. An enterprise incorporated in Kenya is considered a resident of Kenya irrespective of the location of the owners of the enterprise. A branch of a foreign enterprise operating (or intending to operate) in Kenya for more than a year is treated as a resident of Kenya. A household is resident in the economic territory in which household members maintain or intend to maintain a dwelling or succession of dwellings treated and used by members of the household as their principal dwelling. If an individual is present in a territory for one year or more or intending to do so is sufficient to qualify as having a principal dwelling there. If there is uncertainty about the principal dwelling, the length of time spent there should inform whether they are resident or not.

A legal entity is resident in the economic territory under whose laws the entity is incorporated or registered. If there is no incorporation or registration, legal domicile is used to ascertain the residence of the entity.

A Non Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISH) has a center of economic interest in the economy in which the institution was legally created and is officially recognized and recorded as a legal or social entity. When an NPISH is engaged in charity or relief work on an international scale, it may maintain substantial operations for individual territories that may amount to branches.

An exception to this rule includes the following:

1.       Diplomats of Foreign Governments, Embassies, Military bases of foreign governments, cross-border workers, Patients and Students who are residents of their economies.

2.     International/multilateral organizations who are not residents of any Government e.g. World Bank Group, International Monetary Fund. International organizations are resident in an economic territory of their own, and not of the economy in which they are physically located. Some international organizations cover a group of economies in a particular region, such as with economic or currency unions. If statistics are prepared for that region as a whole, these regional organizations are residents of the region as a whole, even though they are not residents of any member economy.

#### Transactions

A transaction is an interaction between two institutional units that occurs by mutual agreement or through the operation of the law and involves an exchange of value or a transfer. Transactions are classified according to the nature of the economic value provided—namely, goods or services, primary income, secondary income, capital transfers, nonproduced non-financial assets, financial assets, or liabilities. Transactions recorded in the BOP. are interactions between a resident and a nonresident institutional unit.

#### Positions

Stock of financial assets and liabilities at a specific point in time and are recorded in the IIP.

#### Financial Instruments

These are financial contracts made between institutional units and can be broadly divided into:

·       Equity and Investment Fund shares: These include shares and other forms of ownership in an enterprise.

·       Non-Equity/Debt Instruments: These include currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, trade credits and advances; other accounts receivables/payables, insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes, financial derivatives and employee stock options are also included in other financial instruments.

#### Reinvested Earnings

Income on equity not paid out to investors as dividends but retained in the enterprise (e.g., retained profits).

#### Revaluations

Changes in the value of assets due to price changes and reflect nominal hold- ing gains and losses on environmental assets. The nominal holding gain for environmental assets is calculated in the same way as for non-financial assets, as the increase in value accruing to the owner of the asset as a result of a change in its price over a period of time. Holding gains and losses are realized when the asset is sold or liability extinguished. Holding gains and losses on unsold assets and unpaid liabilities are unrealized but are recorded as revaluations.

#### Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)

SDRs are an international reserve asset created by the IMF, used to supplement its member countries' official reserves. SDR holdings represent unconditional rights to obtain foreign exchange or other reserve assets from other IMF members. SDR holdings are classified as reserve assets in while SDR allocations are captured in Other Investments liabilities.

#### Valuation Principles

Valuation principles for measuring cross-border transactions and positions are market prices or book values for assets and liabilities.

#### Accrual Accounting

Accrual accounting records flows at the time economic value is created, transformed, exchanged, transferred, or extinguished. This means that flows that imply a change of economic ownership are recorded when ownership passes and services are recorded when provided, irrespective of whether cash was received or paid or was due to be received or paid.

#### Market Value

Market prices for transactions are defined as amounts of money that willing buyers pay to acquire something from willing sellers; the exchanges are made between independent parties and on the basis of commercial considerations only—sometimes called “at arm’s length”. Transactions in loans, deposits, and other accounts receivable/ payable also should be valued at market prices. Transactions in financial assets and liabilities should be recorded exclusive of any commissions, fees, and taxes whether charged explicitly, included in the purchaser’s price, or deducted from the seller’s proceeds. When market prices for transactions are not observable, valuation according to market-equivalent prices provides approximation to market prices. In such cases, market prices of the same or similar items when such prices exist will provide a good basis for applying the principle of market prices.

#### Book Value

The value recorded in the enterprises records.

#### Nominal Value

The outstanding amount the debtor owes to the creditor, which is composed of the outstanding principal amount including any accrued interest. Therefore, the nominal value reflects the sum of funds originally advanced, plus any subsequent advances, plus any interest that has accrued, less any repayments (which includes any payments covering interest accrual). If a debt instrument is denominated in foreign currency, the corresponding nominal value of the instrument in domestic currency also includes holding gains or losses arising from exchange rate changes.

#### Amortized value

The amortized value of a loan reflects the process of gradual elimination of the liability by regular payments over a specified period of time. On the date of each scheduled payment, amortized value is the same as nominal value, but it may differ from the nominal value on other dates because nominal value includes interest that has accrued and not been paid.

#### Face value

The undiscounted amount to be paid to the holder at maturity. It is also known as “par value” or simply “par.” Before maturity, the market value of a bond may be greater or lesser than the face value, depending on the interest rate payable and the perceived risk of default. As bonds approach maturity, market value approaches face value. For example, if interest rates are higher than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold at a discount (below par). Conversely, if interest rates are lower than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold at a premium (above par).

#### Net Errors and Omissions

In practice, data may not perfectly match due to various statistical discrepancies, either from source data or from compilation. This gives rise to net errors and omissions. While net errors and omissions is a residual item, the size and trends may help identify data problems, such as coverage or misreporting. Patterns in net errors and omissions may provide useful information on data problems. While it is not possible to have guidelines on an acceptable size for net errors and omissions, it can be assessed in relation to other items, such as GDP, current account balance, positions data, and gross flows.

#### Institutional Sectors

BPM6 provides guidance for compilation of BOP and IIP by attributing institutional units to the following sectors:

●       Central Bank

○      Deposit taking Corporations except the Central Bank

○      General government

●       Other Sectors

■       Other financial corporations

●       Moneymarketfunds(MMFs)

●       Non-MMF Investment funds

●       Other financial intermediaries except insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPFs)

●        Financial auxiliaries

●       Captive financial institutions and money lenders

●        Insurance corporations

●       Pension funds

■       Non-financial corporations, households, and NPISHs

●       Nonfinancial corporations

●        Households

●       NPISHs (non-profit institutions serving households; maybe combined with households)

The full institutional sector detail is required for international accounts to be fully integrated with monetary, flow of funds, and other financial data.

#### Exceptional Financing

Brings together financial arrangements made by the authorities (or by other sectors fostered by authorities) of an economy to meet Balance of Payments needs. Arrears related to exceptional financing are recorded below the line as transactions in the analytical presentation of the Balance of Payments with the corresponding entry in the relevant instrument.

#### The International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS)

This is a data collection system that obtains data from banks and companies at the level of individual transactions. An ideal ITRS measures: (1) cash transactions with nonresidents that pass through domestic banks; (2) cash transactions that pass-through enterprise accounts with banks abroad; (3) transactions on intercompany accounts with nonresident companies; (4) positions; and (5) noncash transactions.

Statistics are compiled from forms submitted to/by domestic banks and from forms submitted by companies.

However, the efficacy of the ITRS is based on the legal framework, accounting systems, and foreign exchange regulations of various economies. In Kenya, the ITRS is a major data source on cross border transactions. However, it is not sufficient to address all the BOP requirements hence the use of complimentary data sources, including surveys to enterprises.

#### Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition

The Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6) is a comprehensive set of guidelines published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It provides standards for compiling and presenting Balance of Payments (BOP) and International Investment Positions (IIP).

### Government Finance Statistics

Covers statistical activities on the general government sector and the broader public sector. It covers the compilation of data on revenues, expenditures, transactions in financial assets and liabilities, and balance sheet data.

#### Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG)

Classification of the government outlays by functions, or socio-economic objectives, that general government units aim to achieve through the outlays.

#### Economic classification

Classification of government outlays used to identify the types of expense incurred when a government supplies goods and services to the community or redistributes income and wealth.

#### Expense

A transaction involving exchange and transfer that reduces the net worth of the government.

#### Revenue

A set of exchange and transfer transactions that increase the net worth of the government.

#### Compensation of employees

The expense involving total remuneration, in cash or in kind, payable to a government employee in return for work done during the accounting period, except for work connected to own-account capital formation

#### Use of Goods and Service

An expense that involves purchase of goods and services for production of market and nonmarket goods and services Plus goods purchased for resale Minus the change in inventories of materials, work-in- progress, finished goods, and goods held for resale. The value is recorded when goods or services are actually used rather than when they were acquired

#### Interest

The expense that a government unit (debtor) incurs for use of the principal outstanding, which is the economic value that has been provided by the creditor. Interest accrues continuously over period that the liability exists

#### Subsidies

Current transfers that government units pay to enterprises either on the basis of the levels of their production activities or on the basis of the quantities or values of the goods or services that they produce, sell, or import.

#### Social Benefits

Social benefits represent the government's financial contributions to support its citizens' welfare. They are typically non-market transfers (e.g., financial aid) aimed at improving economic security.

#### Current Grants

Current transfers are voluntary transfers from the central government to other levels of government for the purpose their current expenditure

#### Capital Grants

Capital transfers are voluntary transfers from the central government to other levels of government for the purpose of their capital expenditure

#### Acquisition of Non-financial assets

Transactions involving a monetary exchange for produced and non-produced fixed assets, inventories, valuables; most nonfinancial assets provide benefits either through their use in the production of goods and services or in the form of property income.

#### Acquisition of Financial assets

These are transactions that entail the government to a financial claim from a second unit; the financial assets include participation of equity, monetary gold, and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) allocated by the IMF.

#### Public debt redemption

Total outlays during an accounting period towards principal repayment thus reducing the liabilities for the government

#### Tax revenue

Taxes are compulsory unrequited transfers to the general government sector from resident households and enterprises.

#### Value Added Tax (VAT)

A consumption tax levied at each stage of production of goods and services based on the value added to the product at that stage.

#### Excise Duty

Tax levied on specific goods and commodities produced or sold within the country. The level of duty is dependent upon the Government policy to raise revenue, protect industries or discourage consumption.

#### Import Duty

A levy imposed on imported goods.

#### Non-Tax Revenue

Certain compulsory transfers, such as fines, penalties, and most social security contributions.

#### Grants

Voluntary unrequited transfers received/paid by government units from/to other government units or international organizations.

#### Stock of Domestic Debt

The total stock of liabilities that the Government owes to residents.

#### Stock of External Debt

The total stock of liabilities that the Government owes to non-residents.

### Monetary and Financial Statistics

#### Monetary statistics

Covers the stock and flow of the financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities of an economy's financial corporations sector.

#### Financial statistics

Covers the stock and flow of the financial assets and liabilities of all sectors of an economy.

#### Net foreign assets

Gross foreign assets less gross foreign liabilities of depository corporations

#### Domestic credit

Credit advanced by Depository Corporations to resident institutions and individuals

#### Commercial banks

A commercial bank is the most common designation of a deposit-taking corporation but use of the term “bank” in the name of an entity does not imply it is actually a commercial bank. It should be classified as a bank based on the types of activities undertaken and not based on the name alone. The most common services provided by commercial banks are accepting deposits and granting loans or other forms of finance to corporations and households.

#### Micro Finance Institutions

Institutions providing financial services mainly credit, savings, insurance etc. to those sectors of the economy considered risky by commercial banks. Their target market is typically poor households and micro and small enterprises.

They can be classified into:

1)         Microfinance banks

2)         Non-deposit Microfinance

3)         Digital Credit Providers

#### Liquidity

The ability to sell assets quickly and in large volume without substantially affecting their price. A financial asset is liquid if, at short notice and minimum cost, it can be bought, sold, redeemed at, or close to, full value. This means that to be liquid, a financial asset must be exchangeable against a medium of exchange with minimum cost and time, and without unduly affecting the value of the asset.

#### Deposits

All funds received or held by the reporting institution on behalf of third parties that are represented by evidence of deposit. This item covers the reporting institution’s deposit liabilities of all maturities with credit balances

#### Loans

Funds borrowed by the institutions and individuals from institutional units/sectors which are evidenced by on-negotiable documents, including credit cards.

#### Non-performing loans

A loan is non-performing when payments of interest or principal are past due by 90 days or more. However, the period by which institutions classify a loan as non performing may vary.

#### Broad money supply (M1 M2 M3)

The main categories of money are:

a.     **M0** Currency outside the banking system excluding commemorative coins

b.     **M1** M0 + demand deposits of banks (or depository corporations) plus other deposits at CBK

c.      **Quasi Money** comprises of call plus 7 days deposits, savings and time deposits.

d.     **Broad Money (M2)** M1 + Quasi (long term) money deposits (time and savings deposits of banks). This was previously M3. The previous M2 was this aggregate less both quasi-money deposits in non- bank financial institutions and their holding of cash in till and any deposits they hold in other banks.

e.     **Extended Broad Money (M3)** M2 + resident foreign currency deposits.

f.       **Overall Liquidity** M3 + non-bank holdings of Government securities

#### Demand deposits

Deposits which are subject to transfer by cashing out or cheques. Demand deposits consist of deposits (in local and foreign currency) which are immediately convertible into cash and which are transferable by cheque, banker’s order, debit entry etc, without significant restriction or penalty.

#### Time deposits

Deposits which are usually not subject to transfer by cheque and are lodged for a definite period, subject to advance notice of withdrawal.

#### Saving deposits

Deposits lodged for no fixed period. Certain conditions are applicable to depositors who wish to avail cheque facilities.

#### Deposit taking financial corporations

Deposit taking financial corporations have financial intermediation as their principal activity. They obtain funds through the acceptance of deposits or other financial instruments such as short-term certificates of deposits

#### Capital account

The first of four accounts dealing with changes in the values of assets held by institutional units. It records the values of the non-financial assets that are acquired, or disposed of, by resident institutional units by engaging in transactions and to show the change in net worth due to saving and capital transfers.

#### Real-time gross settlement

A payment system where both processing and final settlement of funds transfer instructions take place continuously (i.e. in real time) from one bank to another.

#### Central Bank Rate

The rate of interest Central Bank charges on loans to banks.

#### Repo rate

The interest paid by the Central Bank to Commercial Banks for lending money in the repo market. Repurchase Agreements (Repo) are conducted whenever the Central Bank is mopping up excess liquidity from the domestic market. A Repo is a collateralized loan involving a contractual arrangement between two parties, whereby one party sells a security at a specified price with a commitment to buy back the same at a later date.

#### Inter-bank rate

The rate of interest charged on short-term loans between banks. Banks borrow and lend money in the interbank lending market in order to manage liquidity and satisfy regulations such as reserve requirements.

#### Overdraft

Overdraft is a financial instrument to provide an extension of credit when the current account balance reaches zero.

#### Loans-deposit Spread

This is the difference between the Loans and Advances interest rate and the Average Deposits rate.

#### Real principal interest rate

Lending interest rate adjusted for inflation

#### Equities market

This is a financial market for companies seeking to raise equity capital. It offers a liquid market for issuers enabling them to access a wide range of domestic and international retail and institutional investors.

#### Long term insurance

This excludes enterprises grown for leisure, home beauty, landscaping, etc. Also exclude enterprises gathered in natural forests, hunting, etc. Rearing of horses, cats, dogs, etc. for consumption as food or sale or any other agricultural purposes is considered an agricultural enterprise. However, dogs, cats are captured as companion animals.

####  Agricultural Holding

An agricultural holding is an economic unit of agricultural production under single management comprising all livestock kept and all land used wholly or partly for agricultural production purposes, without regard to title, legal form or size. Single management may be exercised by an individual or household, jointly by two or more individuals or households, by a clan or tribe, or by a juridical person such as a corporation, cooperative or government agency. The holding’s land may consist of one or more parcels, located in one or more separate areas or in one or more territorial or administrative divisions, providing the parcels share the same production means, such as labour, farm buildings, machinery or draught animals. There are two types of agricultural holdings: (i) holdings in the household sector – that is, those operated by household members; and (ii) holdings in the non-household sector, such as corporations and government institutions.

#### Agricultural Household

A household is considered to be an agricultural household when at least one member of the household is operating a holding (farming household) or when the household head, reference person or main income earner is economically active in agriculture.

#### Agricultural Holder

A civil person, group of civil persons or juridical person who makes the major decisions regarding resource use and exercises management control over the agricultural holding operation. The agricultural holder has technical and economic responsibility for the holding and may undertake all responsibilities directly, or delegate responsibilities related to day to day work management to a hired manager. A holder may be resident in the farm (in case of ranches) or on a piece of land in communal areas where ploughing or animal husbandry takes place (in case of pastoral/arable/subsistence farming). The holder may also be resident somewhere else but still making major decisions on the operations of the holding.

#### Hired Manager

The person who manages an agricultural holding on behalf of the agricultural holder and is responsible for the normal daily financial and production routines of running the holding. The hired manager is a paid employee.

#### Farmer

A person/an individual or company/institution or agency involved in agricultural enterprise, which includes growing of crops/trees/fodder; keeping livestock and or rearing fish under single management. The farmer is the person who exercises overall management or control over the agricultural operations within the farm or holding and takes major decisions regarding the use of resources for farm production as well as utilization of the output or income from the farming enterprise. The farmer is financially responsible for the enterprise, pays the bills, bears all the risks, and makes the profits/loss directly resulting from the farming operations. The farmer may own the holding/land; they may be a tenant (leased in the farm) or they may occupy the land for farming without either owning or paying to the owner for their occupancy (squatter/temporary occupation).

#### Statistical Unit

The statistical unit for a data collection is the basic unit for which data are collected. For purposes of agricultural data collection, a statistical unit is the agricultural holding.

#### Agricultural Season

Area under the holder’s house (including the yard around it) is also classified here if it makes up part of the agricultural holding.

#### Farm Land

This is land used for agricultural purposes. Farm land consists of crop land, pasture land and grazing land.

#### Arable Land

This is land that is used in most years for growing temporary crops. It includes land used for growing temporary crops during a twelve-month reference period, as well as land that would normally be so used but is lying fallow or has not been sown due to unforeseen circumstances. Arable land does not include land under permanent crops or land that is potentially cultivable but is not normally cultivated.

####  Fertilization

Process of adding nutrients to a pond to increase the number of phytoplankton and other aquatic life, which in turn provides more food for fish.

####  Aquaponics

The combination of aquaculture and hydroponics. In aquaponics, the nutrient-rich water that results from raising fish provides a source of natural fertilizer for the growing plants. As the plants consume the nutrients, they help to purify the water that the fish live in. A natural microbial process keeps both the fish and plants healthy. Aquaponics therefore produces both fish and organic or chemical free fruits and vegetables, in a dynamic, pond- type ecosystem.

All fuel and other energy products leaving the national territory. Goods simply being transported through a country (goods in transit) and goods temporarily withdrawn are excluded, while re-exports (i.e. foreign goods exported in the same state as previously imported) are included. Also excluded are quantities of fuels delivered for use by merchant ships (including passenger ships) and civil aircraft of all nationalities during international transport of goods and passengers. Note that the country of destination of energy products (i.e. the country of the last known destination as it is known at the time of exportation) should be recorded as a country to which these products are exported to, but not a transit country.

It should be noted that the definitions of imports and exports used in energy statistics are those adopted by international merchandise trade statistics for a system of recording known as the general trade system, that is, all energy products entering and leaving the national territory of a country and which add to or are subtracted from the stock of material resources of a country are recorded as energy imports and exports, except for the bunkering of international fleet, which is excluded from trade figures. It should also be noted that, in energy balances, imports and exports exclude nuclear fuels as these are not within the scope of energy balances.

#### International marine bunkers

Quantities of fuels delivered to merchant ships (including passenger ships) of any nationality for consumption during international voyages transporting goods or passengers. International voyages take place when the ports of departure and arrival are in different national territories. Fuels delivered for consumption by ships during domestic transportation, fishing or military uses are not included here, but are considered part of final consumption of energy (see para. 5.94 for domestic navigation). For the purposes of energy statistics, international marine bunkers are not included in exports; they are recorded separately due to their importance, e.g. for the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions.

#### International aviation bunkers

Quantities of fuels delivered to civil aircraft of any nationality for consumption during international flights transporting goods or passengers. International flights take place when the ports of departure and arrival are in different national territories. Fuels delivered for consumption by aircraft undertaking domestic or military flights are not included here, but are considered part of final consumption of energy. For the purposes of energy statistics, international aviation bunkers are not included in exports; they are recorded separately due to their importance, e.g. for the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions.

#### Stock changes

For the purposes of energy statistics, stocks are quantities of energy products that are held on the national territory and can be used to: (a) maintain service under conditions where supply and demand are variable in their timing or amount due to normal market fluctuations, or (b) supplement supply in the case of a supply disruption.Stocks used to manage a supply disruption may be called ”strategic” or “emergency” stocks and are often held separately from stocks designed to meet normal market fluctuations, but both are considered here. Stock changes are defined as the increase (stock build) or decrease (stock draw) in the quantity of stocks over the reporting period and thus are calculated as a difference between the closing and opening stocks.

#### Transfers

Essentially statistical devices to overcome practical classification and presentation issues resulting from changes in use or identity of a product. Transfers comprise products transferred and interproduct transfers. Products transferred refers to the reclassification (renaming) of products, which, for example, is necessary when finished oil products are used as feedstock in refineries. Interproduct transfers refer to the movements of fuels between product categories because of reclassification of a product that no longer meets its original specification. For example, aviation turbine fuel that has deteriorated or has been spoiled may be reclassified as heating kerosene.

#### Transformation

The process where part or all of the energy content of a product entering a process moves from this product to one or more different products leaving the process (e.g., from coking coal to coke, from crude oil to oil products, or from fuel oil to electricity) (see section D.2 for further discussion).

#### Losses

Losses during the transmission, distribution and transport of fuels, heat and electricity. Losses also include venting and flaring of manufactured gases, losses of geothermal heat after production and pilferage of fuels or electricity. However, production of secondary gases includes quantities subsequently vented or flared. This ensures that a balance can be constructed between the use of the primary fuels from which the gases are derived and the production of the gases.

#### Energy industries own use

The consumption of fuels and energy for the direct support of the production and preparation for use of fuels and energy, except heat not sold. As such, it covers not only own use by energy industries as defined in para. 5.23, but also by other energy producers. Quantities of fuels transformed into other fuels or energy are not included here, but within transformation; neither are quantities used within parts of the energy industry not directly involved in the activities listed in the definition.

These quantities are reported within final consumption.

#### Non-energy use

The use of energy products as raw materials for the manufacture of products outside the scope of SIEC, as well as for direct uses that do not involve using the products as a source of energy, nor as a transformation input. Examples are lubrication, sealing, preservation, road surfacing and use as a solvent.

##### Charcoal

Covers the solid residue of the destructive distillation and pyrolysis of wood and other vegetal material. Since charcoal is a secondary product, its treatment is slightly different from that of the other primary biofuels. Production of charcoal (an output in the transformation process) is offset by the inputs of primary biofuels into the charcoal production process. The losses from this process are included in the transformation processes. Other supply (e.g. trade and stock changes) as well as consumption are aggregated directly with the primary biofuels. In some countries, only primary biofuels are reported.

The domestic/international split should be determined on the basis of departure and landing locations and not by the nationality of the airline. Note that this may include journeys of considerable length between two airports in a country (e.g. San Francisco to Honolulu). For many countries this incorrectly includes fuel used by domestically owned carriers for outbound international traffic.

### Customs Territory

The territory in which the customs law of a state applies in full

### Exports

Outward flow of goods and services from an economic territory to the rest of the world.

### Domestic Exports/Exports

Goods produced/manufactured in a country being exported to other countries or sold at aircraft or shipstores.

### Re-exports

These consist of previously imported goods which are subsequently exported to other countries or to aircraft or ship stores in the same form they were imported into the country or after minor operations like packaging.

### Total Exports

This is the sum of Domestic Exports and Re-exports.

### Imports

Inward flow of goods and services from the rest of the world to an economic territory/country.

### Imports for Home Use

Imports for home use means imported goods that have been cleared by Custom Authorities to enter the local market. These goods can be either imported directly or released by Customs from bonded warehouses.

### Trade volume

This is the sum of Total Exports and Imports

### Trade Balance

This refers to the total value of goods exported, minus the total value of goods imported by a given economy in a given period of time. A positive trade balance (trade surplus) indicates that a country is exporting more in value terms than it is importing. A negative trade balance (trade deficit) indicates that the country imports more as compared to what it exports.

### Export-Import Cover ratio

This refers to the proportion of total exports to imports. It measures the proportion of import bills financed by export revenues. The higher the better for an economy.

### Terms of Trade (TOT)

Terms of Trade measure a country's export prices relative to its import prices. A higher term of trade means the export prices are increasing faster than import prices and the better for an economy.

### Principal commodities

These are goods that either a country produces in abundance and sells to other nations, generating foreign currency for the country over time or goods that a country needs to buy from other economies because they either don’t produce them locally or lack the capacity to produce them in sufficient quantities.

### Assessment Date

The date on which customs completes assessment of customs duties and other necessary assessments or inspections on the goods traded. It is at this time that a good is considered as an export or an import.

### Import valuation

Imports are valued on cost insurance freight (**cif**) basis which means the import value of the commodity includes the cost/price of the goods, the transportation and insurance charges up to the custom frontiers of the importing country.

### Export valuation

Exports are valued on a free on board (**fob**) basis which means the export value of the commodity includes the cost/price of the goods, the transportation and insurance charges if any up to the custom frontiers of the exporting country.

### Trade Agreement

An agreement between two countries or more countries setting out the conditions under which trade between or amongst them will be conducted.

### Common External Tariff (CET)

The uniform tariff rates applied by member states of a customs union against non-member states. Kenya is in the EAC Customs Union and therefore applies EAC-CET.

### Applied Tariff Rate

## Prices

### Annual Inflation Rate

The annual inflation rate is the change in the overall index e.g. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items of the relevant month of the current year compared with the overall index for all items of the same month in the previous year expressed as a percentage.

### Base Effect

The base effect refers to the impact of the rise in price level (i.e. last year’s inflation) in the previous year over the corresponding rise in the price levels in the current year (i.e. current inflation). The base effect therefore helps to explain the changes in the annual inflation or the rate at which it diminishes or grows compared to the previous month.

### Base Period

Period with which all periods are compared, and the value of the period is 100. It is a reference period for all periods in the index. The following types of base periods must be distinguished.

       i.          **Index reference period:** this is the period for which the value of the index is set at 100.

     ii.          **Price reference period:** the period that provides the prices to which the prices in other periods are compared. The prices of the price reference period appear in the denominators of the price relatives, or price ratios, used to calculate the index.

   iii.          **Weight reference period:** this is the period/year for which the expenditure shares serve as the weights for a set of price relatives or elementary price indices.

###  Basket of Goods and Services

A national set of goods and services, specified in terms of commodity and quantity which are used for the compilation of an index. For the CPI it comprises goods and services that are acquired by households in the base period.

### Brands

### Central Product Classification (CPC)

An international classification of goods and services based on the physical characteristics of goods and services or on the nature of the services rendered.

### Chain Index

This is an index number in which the value of any given period is related to the value of its immediately preceding period.

### Chaining/Chain Linking

The construction of a continuous price series by multiplying together price indices that have been constructed using different weight reference periods. The resulting index is referred to as a chain index.

### Classification of Individual Consumption according to Purpose (COICOP)

This is the international reference classification of household expenditure. The objective of COICOP is to provide a framework of homogeneous categories of goods and services, which are considered a function or purpose of household consumption expenditure. The classification has divisions, groups, classes, sub classes, micro classes and elementary aggregates.

### Construction Input Price Index (CIPI)

Measures change over time in the general level of prices of inputs in the construction of civil engineering and building projects. The inputs include materials, equipment, labour, transport and fuels among others.

### Consumer Price Index (CPI)

Measures change over time in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption. The basket relates to a selection of goods and services that is representative of the consumption habits of most households in the country.

### Consumption

Any activity in which households use goods and/or services to satisfy their needs and wants but not for business purposes nor for the acquisition of wealth. Thus, investment in all forms of assets is excluded.

### Core Inflation

This is inflation computed from an index derived from the overall CPI which is intended to show the underlying trend in inflation by excluding price movements arising from transient or volatile product groups.

### Cost of Living Index

It is an index that measures differences in the price of goods and services, and allows for substitutions to other items as prices change. It measures the change between two periods in the minimum expenditures that would be required to achieve a constant standard of living (that is level of utility or economic well-being).

### Elementary Aggregate

The lowest level of groups of goods or services for which expenditure weights are assigned and held constant for a fixed period of time. It consists of a relatively homogeneous set of goods and services, with similar characteristics, content, price or price change.

### Export Import Price Index (XMPI)

Measure the overall change in the price component of transactions in goods and services between the residents of an economic territory and residents of the rest of the world.

### Fixed-Base Index

This is where the value of every period in a time series is directly related to the same value of one fixed base period.

### Headline Inflation Rate

This is the total inflation in an economy, for a basket of goods and services, that is, for all items including commodities like food and energy.

### Index Number

An index number is a statistical measure used to evaluate relative changes in a variable or group of variables, such as price, quantity, or value, over time, across different geographical locations, or according to other characteristics.

### Inflation

Inflation is defined as a sustained increase in the general level of prices for goods and services over a period.

### Input Producer Price Index

Measure of the change in the prices of goods and services bought as intermediate inputs by domestic producers. Covers both domestically produced intermediate inputs and imported intermediate inputs.

### Item

An individual specified good or service in the sample of products selected for pricing.

### Jevons Price Index

This is an elementary price index defined as the un-weighted geometric average of the sample price relatives.

### Laspyres Index

A weighted aggregative index showing the ratio of expenditures in the current period (p2q1, where p2 is the current period price and q1 is the base period quantity) to the expenditure in the base period (p1q1, where p1 is the base period price and q1 is the base period quantity) to purchase the identical market basket of items. A laspeyres price index is computed by taking the ratio of the total cost of purchasing a specified group of commodities at current prices to the cost of that same group at base-period prices and multiplying by 100.

### Modified Laspyres Index

In recent years, there has been a further modification of the Laspeyres formula to suit item replacements in the index basket from time to time due to several reasons, including the smooth substitution of new items and frequent weight updates every month. The modification yields the so-called modified Laspeyres’ formula.

### Monthly Inflation Rate

The monthly inflation rate is the percentage change in the index (e.g. CPI) of the relevant month compared to the index of the previous month. The monthly inflation rate reflects short-term changes in the average prices.

### Outlet

This refers to a place where goods and services can be purchased and from where the purchasers’ or list prices of the products sold can be obtained. It may be a shop, a market stall, a catalogue, a website, etc. Also referred to as a “retail outlet”, although it can include wholesale outlets which also sell directly to the consumer.

### Output Producer Price Index

Measure of the change in the prices of goods and services sold as output by domestic producers. Covers both output sold on the domestic market and output sold as exports. Valuation is at basic prices.

### Price Relative

A price relative is the ratio of the price of a specific product in one period to the price of the same product in some other period.

### Producer Price Index (PPI)

Measure changes in the prices of domestic produced goods and services. It is a measure of the change in the prices of goods and services either as they leave their place of production or as they enter the production process.

### Products (also referred to as “commodities)

These are goods and services normally intended for sale on the market at a price that is designed to cover their cost of production.

### Quarterly Inflation Rate

The quarterly inflation rate is the percentage change in the index (e.g. CPI) of the relevant quarter compared to the index of the previous quarter. The quarterly inflation rate reflects short -term changes in the average prices.

### Representative Product

Product, or category of products, that accounts for a significant proportion of the total expenditures within an elementary aggregate, and/or for which the average price change is expected to be close to the average for all products within the aggregate, e.g. maize flour may have a larger share than millet flour.

###  Weight

It is the relative consumption or production share of an item or group of items to the total consumption of households or production. In a CPI context, weight is the total household consumption expenditure on a given elementary aggregate expressed as a share of total consumption expenditure of all elementary aggregates.

This category only includes the acquisition of capital goods for innovation that is not included in R&D activities.

###  Acquisition of other external knowledge

This innovation activity includes the acquisition of rights to use patents and non-patented inventions, licences, disclosures of knowhow, trademarks, designs and patterns from other enterprises and institutions such as universities and government research institutions, other than R&D. Acquisition of external knowledge may also include computer services and other scientific and technical services for product and process innovations activities.

### Business enterprise expenditure on R&D (BERD)

Represents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Business enterprise sector (see the definition of Business enterprise sector). It is the measure of intramural R&D expenditures within the Business enterprise sector during a specific reference period.

### Business enterprise sector (for R&D data)

In the context of R&D statistics, the business enterprise sector comprises:

a.     All resident corporations, including not only legally incorporated enterprises, regardless of the residence of their shareholders. This group includes all other types of quasi-corporations, i.e. units capable of generating a profit or other financial gain for their owners, recognised by law as separate legal entities from their owners, and set up for purposes of engaging in market production at prices that are economically significant.

b.     The unincorporated branches of non-resident enterprises are deemed to be resident because they are engaged in production on the economic territory on a long-term basis.

c.      All resident non-profit institutions (NPIs) that are market producers of goods or services or serve business.

d.     This sector comprises both private and public enterprises.

### Business population

All firms in the business sector, which can be disaggregated by economic activity and size class.

Capital R&D expenditures are the annual gross amount paid for the acquisition of fixed assets that are used repeatedly or continuously in the performance of R&D for more than one year. They should be reported in full for the period when they took place, whether acquired or developed in house, and should not be registered as an element of depreciation. The most relevant types of assets used for R&D for which capital R&D expenditures should be compiled are:

a.   Land and buildings

b.   Machinery and equipment

c.    Capitalised computer software

d.   Other intellectual property products.

### Capitalised computer software (in capital R&D expenditures)

This includes the costs of computer software that is used in the performance of R&D for more than one year. It includes longterm licences or the acquisition of separately identifiable computer software, including programme descriptions and supporting materials for both systems and applications software. The production costs (e.g. labour and materials) of internally produced software should be reported. Software from external vendors may be obtained through the outright purchase of rights or licences to use. Software used or licensed for one year or less should be reported under current expenditures.

### Contracted-out (external) R&D

Any creative work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge for developing innovations but performed by other firms (including other firms or subsidiaries within the group) or by public or private research organizations and purchased by the firm.

### Cooperation for innovation activities

Active participation in joint innovation projects with other organizations. Pure contracting out of work, where there is no active collaboration, is not regarded as cooperation.

### Current R&D expenditures

These are composed of labour costs and other current costs (including for external R&D personnel) used in R&D. Services and items (including equipment) used and consumed within one year are current expenditures. Annual fees or rents for the use of fixed assets should be included in current expenditures.

### Degree of novelty - new to the firm

Implementation by a firm of a new or significantly improved good or service that was already available from its competitors in the market. A product, process, marketing method or organizational method may already have been implemented by other firms, but if it is new to the firm, then it is an innovation for that firm.

### Degree of novelty - new to the market

Implementation of a new or significantly improved good or service by a firm on its market before its competitors. The geographical scope of new to the market is subject to the firm’s own view of its operating market and may include both domestic and international firms.

### Degree of novelty - new to the world

Innovation is new to the world when the firm is the first to implement the innovation for all markets and industries, domestic and international. New to the world therefore implies a qualitatively greater degree of novelty than new to the market.

### Engineering and technology (for R&D data)

Engineering and technology include: civil engineering; electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering; mechanical engineering; chemical engineering; materials engineering; medical engineering; environmental engineering; environmental biotechnology; industrial biotechnology; nano-technology; and other engineering and technologies.

### Exchange funds for R&D

Exchange funds for R&D are funding flows from one statistical unit to another statistical unit in return for the performance of R&D and the delivery of relevant R&D outcomes. The unit funding the work incurs a delivery risk associated with the uncertainty of the project. Examples of exchange funds activities include R&D purchases (sales from the perspective of the performer), R&D outsourcing and contributions in the context of collaborative R&D agreements.

### Experimental development

Experimental development is systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience and producing additional knowledge, which is directed to producing new products or processes or to improving existing products or processes.

### External R&D funds

External R&D funds are the amount of money spent on R&D that originate outside the control of a reporting unit.

### External R&D personnel

External R&D personnel (or contributors) are independent (self-employed) or dependent (employee) workers fully integrated into a statistical unit’s R&D projects without formally being persons employed by the same R&D performing statistical unit.

### Extramural R&D

Any R&D performed outside of the statistical unit about which information is being reported; its “funds for extramural R&D” should include only internal funds (not from external sources) provided to an outside unit for R&D performance including both where there is an expected compensatory delivery of R&D (exchange or purchase) and where no compensatory delivery is expected (transfer or grant). It may also be noted that such funds for extramural R&D often will include payments for costs other than for R&D, such as cost elements covering depreciation costs, performer profit, delivery charges, etc.

Fields of research and development (FORD) The fields of research and development (FORD) classification is used to classify R&D units and resources by fields of enquiry, namely, broad knowledge domains based primarily on the content of the R&D subject matter. The main fields of R&D are:

a.     Natural sciences

b.     Engineering and technology

c.      Medical and health sciences

d.     Agricultural and veterinary sciences

e.     Social sciences

f.       Humanities and the arts.

### Firms with only abandoned or ongoing innovation activities

Firms that did not implement innovations but had abandoned or ongoing innovation activities to develop them. Unless otherwise specified, the term covers product or process innovation, regardless of organizational or marketing innovation.

### Full-time equivalent (FTE) of R&D personnel 

This is defined as the ratio of working hours actually spent on R&D during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year) divided by the total number of hours conventionally worked in the same period by an individual or by a group. In other words, one full-time equivalent may be thought of as one person-year. Therefore, it is measured by combining two variables: actual involvement in R&D activities and formal engagement on the basis of normative/statutory working hours. FTE is considered to be a true measure of the volume of R&D and also the main R&D personnel statistic for international comparisons.

Total intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, broken down by basic research, applied research and experimental development.

### GERD in local currency

Total intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period and reported in current national currency (i.e. expenditure at current prices in national currency).

### GERD in Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs)

Total intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, expressed in Purchasing Power Parity dollars.

### GERD per capita

Total intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period per inhabitant.

### GERD per researcher

Total intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period per researcher.

### Government budget allocations for R&D (GBARD)

It encompasses all spending allocations met from sources of government revenue foreseen within the budget, such as taxation. Spending allocations by extra-budgetary government entities are only within the scope to the extent that their funds are allocated through the budgetary process. Likewise, R&D financing by public corporations is outside the scope of GBARD statistics, as it is based on funds raised within the market and outside the budgetary process. Only in the exceptional case of budgetary provisions for R&D to be carried out or distributed from public corporations should this be counted as part of GBARD.

### Government expenditure on R&D (GOVERD)

It represents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Government sector (see the definition of Government sector). It is the measure of expenditures on intramural R&D within the Government sector during a specific reference period.

Government sector (for R&D data) In the context of R&D statistics, the Government sector consists of the following groups of resident institutional units

a.     All units of central (federal), regional (state) or local (municipal) government, including social security funds, except those units that provide higher education services or fit the description of higher education institutions (see the definition of Higher education sector).

b.     All non-market NPIs that are controlled by government units that are not part of the Higher education sector.

c.      This sector does not include public corporations, even when all the equity of such corporations is owned by government units. Public enterprises are included in the Business enterprise sector.

### Government tax relief for R&D expenditures (GTARD)

It describes tax relief provisions that apply to taxpayers strictly as a result of their engagement in R&D performance and/or funding activities, relative to a normal or baseline tax structure.

### Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) 

It is total intramural expenditure on R&D performed in the national territory during a specific reference period.

### Gross national expenditure on R&D (GNERD)

It comprises total expenditure on R&D financed by a country’s institutions regardless of where the R&D is performed. As such, it includes R&D performed in the “rest of the world” that is financed by national institutions or residents; it excludes R&D performed within a country that is funded from institutions outside of the national territory (that is, from institutions that are part of the “rest of the world”). GNERD is constructed by adding the domestically financed intramural expenditures of each performing sector plus the R&D performed in the “rest of the world” that is financed by domestic funding sectors.

### Grossed up results

Results of the survey extrapolated to the whole target population. Sample survey data represent units in the sample only. Therefore, the sample estimates need to be inflated to represent the whole population of interest. Estimation is the means by which this inflation occurs, also referred to as “grossing up”. Hampering factors for innovation activities Innovation activity may be hampered by a number of factors. There may be reasons for not starting innovation activities at all; there may be factors that slow innovation activities or affect them negatively. These hampering factors include: economic factors, such as high costs or lack of demand; enterprise factors, such as lack of skilled personnel or knowledge; and legal factors, such as regulations or tax rules. Two indicators are calculated:

a.     the percentage of innovation-active firms for which hampering factors were highly important and

b.     the percentage of non-innovative firms for which hampering factors were highly important.

### Headcount (HC) of R&D personnel 

The total number of individuals contributing to intramural R&D, at the level of a statistical unit or at an aggregate level, during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year). That means headcount data reflect the total number of persons who are mainly or partially employed in R&D. The use of HCs is mostly recommended in terms of exploring, usually in percentage terms, the characteristics of R&D personnel.

### Higher education expenditure on R&D (HERD)

Represents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Higher education sector (see the definition of Higher education sector). It is the measure of intramural R&D expenditures within the Higher education sector during a specific period.

Higher education sector (for R&D data) In the context of R&D statistics, the Higher education sector comprises:

a.     All universities, colleges of technology and other institutions providing formal tertiary education programmes (i.e. ISCED levels 5, 6, 7, or 8), whatever their source of finance or legal status.

b.     All research institutes, centres, experimental stations and clinics that have their R&D activities under the direct control of, or are administered by, tertiary education institutions.

### Humanities and the arts (for R&D data)

Humanities and the arts include: history and archaeology; languages and literature; philosophy, ethics and religion; art (arts, history of arts, performing arts, music); and other humanities.

### In-house R&D

Any creative work undertaken within the firm to increase the stock of knowledge for developing innovations (see the Frascati Manual).

### Innovation

Implementation of a new or significantly improved product (good or service), or process, or a new marketing method, or a new organizational method. The minimum requirement for an innovation is that the product, process, marketing method or organizational method must be new (or significantly improved in the case of product or process) to the firm.

### Innovation activities

All scientific, technological, organizational, financial, and commercial steps which actually lead, or are intended to lead, to the implementation of innovations. Some innovation activities are themselves innovative, others are not novel activities but are necessary for the implementation of innovations. Innovation activities also include R&D that is not directly related to the development of a specific innovation. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.

### Innovation-active firms

Firms that have had innovation activities during the observation period of the innovation survey, including those with ongoing and abandoned activities. In other words, firms that have had innovation activities during the observation period, regardless of whether the activity resulted in the implementation of an innovation, are innovation-active. Unless otherwise specified, the term covers product or process innovation, regardless of organizational or marketing innovation. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.

### Innovative firms

Are firms that implemented an innovation. Unless otherwise specified, the term is used to refer to product or process innovative firms, which are also known as product or process innovators. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.

### Internal R&D funds

The amount of money spent on R&D that originate within the control of and are used for R&D at the discretion of a reporting statistical unit. Internal R&D funds do not include R&D funds received from other statistical units explicitly for intramural R&D.

### Internal R&D personnel

Persons employed by the statistical unit who contribute to the unit’s intramural R&D activities.

### Intramural R&D expenditures

All current expenditures plus gross fixed capital expenditures for R&D performed within a statistical unit during a specific reference period, whatever the source of funds. Intramural R&D expenditure is synonymous with the performance of R&D within a statistical unit. The aggregation of intramural R&D for all units within a sector is synonymous with the performance of R&D within a sector of the economy; the summation of intramural R&D for all sectors is synonymous with the performance of R&D for the entire economy (GERD).

### Labour costs (in current R&D expenditures)

Labour costs, or compensation of employed personnel, comprise annual wages and salaries and all associated costs or fringe benefits, such as bonus payments, stock options, holiday pay, contributions to pension funds. The concept of labour costs also includes other social security payments and payroll taxes.

### Land and buildings (in capital R&D expenditures)

Include land acquired for R&D use (e.g. testing grounds, sites for laboratories and pilot plants) and buildings constructed or purchased for R&D use, including major improvements, modifications and repairs.

### Level of formal qualification (for R&D data)

The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) provides the basis for classifying R&D personnel by formal qualification. Five classes are recommended for the purposes of R&D statistics. They are defined exclusively by level of education, regardless of the field in which personnel are qualified.

a.     Doctoral or equivalent level: Programmes at ISCED level 8, or doctoral or equivalent level, are designed primarily to lead to an advanced research qualification. Programmes at this level are devoted to advanced study and original research and are typically offered only by research-oriented tertiary educational institutions such as universities. Doctoral programmes exist in both academic and professional fields.

b.     Master’s or equivalent level: Programmes at level, or Master’s or equivalent level, are often designed to provide participants with advanced academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a second degree or equivalent qualification. Programmes at this level may have a substantial research component but do not yet lead to the award of a doctoral qualification. Typically, programmes at this level are theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and other tertiary educational institutions.

c.      Bachelor’s or equivalent level: Programmes level, Bachelor’s or equivalent level, are often designed to provide participants with intermediate academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a first degree or equivalent qualification. Programmes at this level are typically theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and equivalent tertiary educational institutions. First degree programmes at this level typically have a duration of three to four years of full-time study at the tertiary level.

d.     Short-cycle tertiary education: Programmes at level, or short-cycle tertiary education, are often designed to provide participants with professional knowledge, skills and competencies. Typically, they are practically based, occupationally-specific and prepare students to enter the labour market. However, these programmes may also provide a pathway to other tertiary education programmes.

e.     This includes post-secondary non-tertiary education, upper secondary education and below. Post-secondary non-tertiary education: Post-secondary non-tertiary education provides learning and educational activities building on secondary education preparing for both labour market entry as well as tertiary education. It typically targets students who have completed upper secondary but who want to increase their opportunities either to enter the labour market or to progress to tertiary education. Programmes are often not significantly more advanced than those at upper secondary as they typically serve to broaden rather than deepen knowledge, skills and competencies. It therefore aims at learning below the high level of complexity characteristic of tertiary education. Upper secondary education: Programmes at this level, or ‘upper secondary’ education, are typically designed to complete secondary education in preparation for tertiary education, or to provide skills relevant to employment, or both. Programmes at this level offer students more varied, specialised and in-depth instruction than programmes at lower secondary education. They are more differentiated, with an increased range of options and streams available.

### Machinery and equipment (in capital R&D expenditures)

Cover major (i.e. capitalised) machinery and equipment acquired for use in the performance of R&D.

### Market introduction of innovations

Activities for the market introduction of product innovations, including market research, market tests and launch advertising.

a.       Natural sciences: mathematics; computer and information sciences; physical sciences; chemical sciences; earth and related environmental sciences; biological sciences; other natural sciences;

b.       Engineering and technology: civil engineering; electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering; mechanical engineering; chemical engineering; materials engineering; medical engineering; environmental engineering; environmental biotechnology; industrial biotechnology; nano-technology; and other engineering and technologies;

c.        Medical and health sciences: basic medicine; clinical medicine; health sciences; medical biotechnology; and other medical sciences;

d.       Agricultural and veterinary sciences: agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; animal and dairy science; veterinary science; agricultural biotechnology; and other agricultural sciences.

### Non-innovative firms

Firms without any kind of innovation activity. These firms did not have any innovation implemented nor abandoned or ongoing innovation activities to develop an innovation. Unless otherwise specified, the term refers to product or process innovation, regardless of organizational or marketing innovation.

### Ongoing innovation activities

Innovation activities of a firm that represent work in progress and have not yet resulted in the implementation of an innovation.

### Organizational innovation

The implementation of a new organizational method in the firm’s business practices, workplace organization or external relations.

### Organizational innovators 

Firms that implement organizational innovation.

### Other current costs (in current R&D expenditures)

**C**omprises non-capital purchases of materials, supplies, equipment and services to support R&D performed by the statistical unit in the reference year.

Examples are water and fuel (including gas and electricity); books, journals, reference materials, subscriptions to libraries, scientific societies, etc.; imputed or actual costs of small prototypes or models made outside the statistical unit; and materials for laboratories (e.g. chemicals, animals, etc.). Other current costs include royalties or licences for the use of patents and other intellectual property rights, the lease of capital goods (machinery and equipment, etc.) and the rental of buildings to support R&D performed by the statistical unit in the reference year. The category of other current R&D costs also includes costs for computer software that is used in the performance of R&D for one year or less; costs associated with engaging persons such as on-site consultants who are not employed in the statistical unit but provide direct services that are integrated into the statistical unit’s R&D activities; cost for doctoral and master’s students not employed by the statistical unit (e.g. receiving research grant or scholarship tracked by or through the statistical unit); administrative and other overhead costs, i.e. office, information and telecommunications, utilities, insurance, and costs for indirect or ancillary services, i.e. storage; the use, cleaning, repair and maintenance of buildings and equipment; computer services; and the printing of R&D reports.

### Other intellectual property products (in capital R&D expenditures)

These are costs for purchased patents, long-term licences or other intangible assets used in R&D, and which are in use for more than one year. Other intangibles that can be reported in a unit’s internal financial accounts, such as marketing assets or goodwill, should not be included.

### Other preparations for product and process innovations

This includes other internal activities related to the development and implementation of product and process innovations that are not included in R&D. They include development activities that are either partially excluded as R&D (such as industrial design, engineering and set-up, and trial production) or fully excluded (such as patent and licence work, production start-up, and testing), and development activities for product or process innovations that do not meet the novelty requirement for R&D (i.e., they are new to the firm but not new to the market).

### Other supporting staff

This includes skilled and unskilled craftsmen, and administrative, secretarial and clerical staff participating in R&D projects or directly associated with such projects.

### Other supporting staff by sector of employment

Skilled and unskilled craftsmen, and administrative, secretarial and clerical staff participating in R&D projects or directly associated with such projects, broken down by the sectors they are employed in (business enterprise, government, higher education and private non-profit organizations).

### Performers of R&D

This consists of statistical units that undertake (i.e. perform) R&D in each of the main sectors covered: Business enterprise, Government, Higher education and Private non-profit.

### Preparations for marketing innovations

Activities related to the development and implementation of new marketing methods not previously used by a firm. They include the development and planning of new marketing methods and the work involved in their implementation. Activities related to marketing innovations include only those for developing and implementing new marketing methods, not expenditures for using these methods in daily business. This category also includes the acquisition of other external knowledge of machinery, equipment, and other capital goods and training that are specifically related to marketing innovations.

### Preparations for organizational innovations

Activities related to the development and planning of new organizational methods and the work involved in their implementation. This category also includes the acquisition of other external knowledge of machinery, equipment and other capital goods and training activities that are specifically related to organizational innovations.

### Private non-profit expenditure on R&D (PNPERD)

Thus represents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Private non-profit sector (see the definition of Private non-profit sector). It is the measure of intramural R&D expenditures within the Private non-profit sector during a specific reference period.

### Process innovation

Implementation of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method. This includes significant changes in techniques, equipment or software.

### Product innovation

Implementation of a good or service that is new or significantly improved with respect to its characteristics or intended uses. This includes significant improvements in technical specifications, components and materials, incorporated software, user friendliness or other functional characteristics.

### Process innovators

Firms that implemented process innovation.

### Product innovators

Firms that implemented product innovation.

### Process-only innovators

Firms that implemented process innovation and did not implement product innovation, regardless of organizational or marketing innovation.

### Product-only innovators

Firms that implemented product innovation and did not implement process innovation, regardless of organizational or marketing innovation.

### Product and process innovators

Firms that implemented product innovation as well as process innovation.

### Public general university funds (GUF) (for R&D data)

The R&D funding share coming from the general grant universities receive from the central government (federal) ministry of education or the corresponding provincial (state) or local (municipal) authorities in support of their overall research/teaching activities.

### Purchasing power parity (PPP)

Currency exchange rate that equalizes the purchasing power of different currencies. This means that a given sum of money, when converted into US dollars at the PPP exchange rate (PPP dollars), will buy the same basket of goods and services in all countries. In other words, PPP is the rate of currency conversion which eliminates the differences in price levels among countries. Thus, comparisons between countries reflect only differences in the volume of goods and services purchased.

### R&D coefficients

This is a tool for calculating / estimating the shares of personnel and expenditure data attributable to R&D. They are especially used for distributing total resources among research, teaching and other activities (including administration) in the Higher education sector. They can be used for the total expenditure or for parts of it, like public general university funds (GUF) or for personnel only.

R&D functions classification of personnel d according to their R&D function, which may be researcher, technician or other support staff.

### R&D personnel by sex 

These are researchers, technicians and equivalent staff, and other supporting staff, broken down by sex (male and female).

### Research and experimental development (R&D)

The creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge including knowledge of humankind, culture and society – and to devise new applications of available knowledge. The term R&D covers three types of activity: basic research, applied research and experimental development. For an activity to be an R&D activity, it must satisfy five core criteria. The activity must be:

a.   Novel (to be aimed at new findings)

b.   Creative (to be based on original, not obvious, concepts and hypotheses)

c.    Uncertain (to be uncertain about the final outcome)

d.   Systematic (to be planned and budgeted)

e.   Transferable and/or reproducible (to lead to results that could be possibly reproduced).

### Researchers

These are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge. They conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods.

### Researchers by age

These are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by age. The age groups recommended are: under 25 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, 45-54 years, 55-64 years, and 65 years and more.

### Researchers by fields of research and development

These are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by fields of research and development.

The fields included are:

a.    Natural sciences

b.    Engineering and technology

c.    Medical and health sciences

d.    Agricultural and veterinary sciences

e.    Social sciences

f.     Humanities and the arts.

### Researchers by formal qualification professionals

Engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by their formal level of qualification.

### Researchers by sector of employment professionals

Engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by the sectors they are employed in (business enterprise, government, higher education and private non-profit organizations).

### Researchers by seniority level professionals

Engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by the seniority levels. It is proposed to use the following classification of seniority grades/levels:

a.   Category A: The single highest grade/post at which research is normally conducted. Example: “Director of research” or “Full professor”.

b.   Category B: Researchers working in positions not as senior as top position (A) but more senior than newly qualified doctoral graduates. Example: “Senior researcher” or “Principal investigator” or “Associate professor”.

c.    Category C: The first grade/post into which a newly qualified doctoral graduate would normally be recruited. Examples: “Researcher” or “Investigator” or “Assistant professor” or “Post-doctoral fellow”.

d.   Category D: Either doctoral students who are engaged as researchers, or researchers working in posts that do not normally require a doctorate degree. Examples: “Ph.D. students” or “Junior researchers” (without a Ph.D.). Master’s students who are counted as researchers would also fall under this category."

### Researchers per million inhabitants

The number of professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) during a given year expressed as a proportion of a population of one million.

### Researchers per thousand employment

The number of professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) during a given year expressed as a proportion of 1,000 employed people.

### Researchers per thousand labour force

The number of professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) during a given year expressed as a proportion of a labour force of 1,000 people.

### Rest of the world (for R&D data)

In the context of R&D statistics, the rest of the world (formerly referred to as ‘Abroad’) includes:

a.   All institutions and individuals without a location, place of production or premises within the economic territory on which or from which the unit engages and intends to continue engaging, either indefinitely or over a finite but long period of time, in economic activities and transactions on a significant scale;

b.   All international organisations and supranational entities including facilities and operations within the country’s borders.

### Social sciences (for R&D data)

This includes psychology and cognitive sciences; economics and business; education; sociology; law; political science; social and economic geography; media and communications; and other social sciences.

### Social sciences and humanities (for R&D data)

These include social sciences: psychology and cognitive sciences; economics and business; education; sociology; law; political science; social and economic geography; media and communications; other social sciences; and- Humanities and the arts: history and archaeology; languages and literature; philosophy, ethics and religion; art (arts, history of arts, performing arts, music); and other humanities.

### Source of R&D funds 

This is the unit that provides the funds for R&D performance. Sources may be internal or external to the reporting unit. In surveys and data presentation, external sources are grouped by main sector and relevant subsectors. In broad terms, there are five main sources for R&D funding: Business enterprise, Government, Higher education, Private non-profit and the Rest of the world.

### Sources of information for innovation activities

sources that provided information for new innovation projects or contributed to the completion of existing innovation projects. They provide access to knowledge without the need to pay for the knowledge itself, although there may be marginal fees for access (membership in trade associations, attendance at conferences, subscriptions to journals). Open information sources do not provide access to knowledge embodied in machinery or equipment or the right to use knowledge protected by patents and other forms of intellectual property, although the knowledge behind the patent can be accessed through patent databases. Some open sources, such as attendance at fairs or exhibitions, can give access to some tacit knowledge through personal interaction with other participants.

### Successful innovation activities

These are activities of a firm that resulted in the implementation of an innovation (though not necessarily commercially successful).

### Technicians and equivalent staff 

These are persons whose main tasks require technical knowledge and experience in one or more fields of engineering, the physical and life sciences, or the social sciences, humanities and the arts. They participate in R&D by performing scientific and technical tasks involving the application of concepts, operational methods and the use of research equipment, normally under the supervision of researchers.

### Time-use surveys (for R&D data)

This is a statistical survey that aims to report data on how people spend their time. If the necessary R&D coefficients cannot be derived from other surveys or administrative data, time-use surveys are the recommended method to derive the necessary information for estimating the R&D component of full-time equivalents (FTEs) and expenditures.

### Total R&D personnel

in a statistical unit, these include all persons engaged directly in R&D, whether employed by the statistical unit or external contributors fully integrated into the statistical unit’s R&D activities, as well as those providing direct services for the R&D activities (such as R&D managers, administrators, technicians and clerical staff). Persons providing indirect support and ancillary services, such as canteen, maintenance, administrative and security staff, should be excluded, even though their wages and salaries are included as an overhead cost when measuring R&D expenditure. Two main groups of individuals who potentially contribute to the R&D activities can be identified in a statistical unit: ‘Internal R&D personnel’ and ‘external R&D personnel’. Both groups of R&D personnel are classified according to their R&D function: ‘Researchers’, ‘technicians’ and ‘other supporting staff’. (See the relevant definitions in this glossary).

### Training for innovative activities

These are all the training (including external training) that is required for the development or implementation of product or process innovations.

### Transfer R&D funds 

These are funding flows from one statistical unit to another statistical unit to perform R&D that does not require any good or service in return and where the funder is not entitled to any significant rights on the outcome of the R&D it has funded. The unit that provides transfer funds for R&D may impose some conditions on the performer, such as periodic reporting, compliance with the activity or project description as agreed in the terms of the agreement, or even public dissemination of research outcomes. Examples of transfer funds include grants, debt forgiveness, philanthropy, crowd-funding and personal transfers such as gifts and GUF (by convention for international comparisons). To be included as R&D transfer funds, the funds should be intended by the originating source to be used for R&D. Normally, the R&D performer will retain most rights to the outcomes of the R&D, which explains the transfer nature of this R&D funding transaction.

### Types of costs of R&D

Include individual current and capital cost categories for intramural R&D. Types of current costs include labour costs for internal R&D personnel and other current costs (for external R&D personnel, purchases of services, purchases of materials, and other costs not elsewhere classified. Types of capital costs include land and buildings, machinery and equipment, capitalised computer software and other intellectual property products.

### Types of R&D

Three types of R&D are considered under the term ‘R&D’: basic research, applied research and experimental development.

### Types of R&D funds

These are the funds to cover the costs of R&D involving significant flows between units, sectors and countries. From the perspective of performance, R&D is conducted by the statistical unit with funds either from the statistical unit’s own sources (internal) or from sources outside of the statistical unit (external). From the perspective of funding, R&D funds pay for either the costs of R&D performance within the statistical unit (intramural) or the costs of R&D performance outside of the statistical unit (extramural). There can be a flow of R&D funds between statistical units either with (exchange) or without (transfer) compensatory return flows of R&D from the performer. See the relevant definitions (on ‘internal’ and ‘external’ sources of R&D funds, ‘intramural’ and ‘extramural’ R&D, and ‘exchange’ and ‘transfer’ categories of funds for R&D) in this glossary.
